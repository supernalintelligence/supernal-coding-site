# What is Supernal Coding?

Supernal Coding is a **meta-repository system** that transforms any codebase into an AI-maintained, compliant, and self-validating development environment.

## Core Value Proposition

- **AI-Native Development**: Built for AI agents to understand, navigate, and modify code safely
- **Compliance by Design**: Automated traceability from requirements to tests to deployments
- **Self-Validating**: Continuous validation ensures code meets requirements at all times

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Requirement-Driven Development
Every change traces back to a requirement. Every requirement traces forward to tests and evidence.

### 2. AI Agent Collaboration
Structured handoffs, consistent conventions, and automated context ensure AI agents can work effectively.

### 3. Compliance Automation
SOC2, ISO 13485, FDA 21 CFR Part 11, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance built into your workflow.

### 4. Quality Gates
Pre-commit hooks, automated testing, and validation prevent bad code from entering the codebase.

## Who It's For

- **Regulated Industries**: Healthcare, fintech, aerospace - where compliance is mandatory
- **AI-Forward Teams**: Teams using AI agents for development who need guardrails
- **Quality-Focused Organizations**: Teams that prioritize traceability and documentation
