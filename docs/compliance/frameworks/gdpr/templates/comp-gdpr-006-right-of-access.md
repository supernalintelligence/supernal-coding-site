# COMP-GDPR-006: Right of Access

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data subject right of access implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 15 - Right of access by the data subject  
**Category**: data-subject-rights, access  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Provides data subjects with the right to obtain confirmation of whether personal data concerning them is being processed, access to the personal data, and supplementary information.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Right of Access
  As a data subject
  I want to access my personal data
  So that I can understand how my data is being processed

  Background:
    Given access request procedures are established
    And identity verification mechanisms are implemented
    And data export capabilities are available

  Scenario: Valid Access Request
    Given a data subject submits an access request
    When the request is processed
    Then identity should be verified
    And all personal data should be identified and compiled
    And supplementary information should be included
    And response should be provided within one month

  Scenario: Complex Access Request
    Given an access request requiring extensive data compilation
    When processing the complex request
    Then additional time may be claimed (up to 2 more months)
    And data subject should be informed of the delay and reasons
    And complete response should be provided within extended timeframe

  Scenario: Automated Access Portal
    Given a data subject uses the self-service access portal
    When requesting access to their data
    Then identity should be verified securely
    And data should be provided in structured, commonly used format
    And download should be available immediately for standard requests
```

## Technical Context

### Access Request Management

```typescript
interface AccessRequest {
  id: string;
  dataSubjectId: string;
  requestDate: Date;
  identityVerified: boolean;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'rejected';
  responseDeadline: Date;
  extensionRequested: boolean;
  extensionReason?: string;
  dataPackage?: DataPackage;
}

interface DataPackage {
  personalData: PersonalDataRecord[];
  processingActivities: ProcessingActivity[];
  thirdPartySharing: ThirdPartySharing[];
  retentionPeriods: RetentionInfo[];
  dataSource: DataSourceInfo[];
  automatedDecisionMaking: AutomatedDecisionInfo[];
}

class AccessRequestProcessor {
  async processAccessRequest(request: AccessRequest): Promise<AccessResponse> {
    // Verify identity
    const identityVerified = await this.verifyIdentity(request);
    if (!identityVerified) {
      throw new IdentityVerificationError(
        'Unable to verify data subject identity'
      );
    }

    // Compile personal data
    const dataPackage = await this.compileDataPackage(request.dataSubjectId);

    // Generate response
    const response = await this.generateAccessResponse(dataPackage);

    return {
      requestId: request.id,
      dataPackage,
      format: 'structured_json',
      supplementaryInfo: this.generateSupplementaryInfo(dataPackage),
      generatedDate: new Date(),
    };
  }

  private async compileDataPackage(
    dataSubjectId: string
  ): Promise<DataPackage> {
    return {
      personalData: await this.getAllPersonalData(dataSubjectId),
      processingActivities: await this.getProcessingActivities(dataSubjectId),
      thirdPartySharing: await this.getThirdPartySharing(dataSubjectId),
      retentionPeriods: await this.getRetentionInfo(dataSubjectId),
      dataSource: await this.getDataSources(dataSubjectId),
      automatedDecisionMaking: await this.getAutomatedDecisions(dataSubjectId),
    };
  }
}
```
