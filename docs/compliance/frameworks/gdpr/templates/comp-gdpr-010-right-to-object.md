# COMP-GDPR-010: Right to Object

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data subject right to object implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 21 - Right to object  
**Category**: data-subject-rights, objection  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Provides data subjects with the right to object to processing of personal data in specific circumstances, including direct marketing and automated decision-making.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Right to Object
  As a data subject
  I want to object to processing of my personal data
  So that I can control how my data is used

  Background:
    Given objection procedures are established
    And processing cessation mechanisms are implemented
    And legitimate interest assessments are defined

  Scenario: Direct Marketing Objection
    Given a data subject objects to direct marketing
    When the objection is received
    Then all direct marketing processing should cease immediately
    And data subject should be removed from marketing lists
    And confirmation should be provided to the data subject

  Scenario: Legitimate Interest Objection
    Given a data subject objects to processing based on legitimate interests
    When assessing the objection
    Then legitimate interest assessment should be performed
    And processing should cease unless compelling legitimate grounds exist
    And data subject should be informed of the decision and reasoning

  Scenario: Automated Decision-Making Objection
    Given a data subject objects to automated decision-making
    When the objection is processed
    Then automated processing should be suspended
    And manual review process should be initiated
    And alternative decision-making method should be provided
```

## Technical Context

### Objection Management System

```typescript
interface ObjectionRequest {
  id: string;
  dataSubjectId: string;
  requestDate: Date;
  objectionType:
    | 'direct_marketing'
    | 'legitimate_interest'
    | 'automated_decision'
    | 'public_task';
  processingActivities: string[];
  reasoning?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'upheld' | 'overruled';
}

interface LegitimateInterestAssessment {
  processingActivity: string;
  legitimateInterest: string;
  necessity: string;
  balancingTest: {
    controllerInterests: string[];
    dataSubjectImpact: string[];
    balanceResult: 'compelling' | 'not_compelling';
  };
  safeguards: string[];
  decision: 'continue_processing' | 'cease_processing';
}

class ObjectionProcessor {
  async processObjection(
    request: ObjectionRequest
  ): Promise<ObjectionResponse> {
    switch (request.objectionType) {
      case 'direct_marketing':
        return this.processDirectMarketingObjection(request);
      case 'legitimate_interest':
        return this.processLegitimateInterestObjection(request);
      case 'automated_decision':
        return this.processAutomatedDecisionObjection(request);
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unsupported objection type: ${request.objectionType}`);
    }
  }

  private async processDirectMarketingObjection(
    request: ObjectionRequest
  ): Promise<ObjectionResponse> {
    // Direct marketing objections must be upheld immediately
    await this.ceaseDirectMarketing(request.dataSubjectId);
    await this.updateMarketingPreferences(request.dataSubjectId, false);

    return {
      requestId: request.id,
      decision: 'upheld',
      reasoning:
        'Direct marketing objection automatically upheld per GDPR Article 21(2)',
      actionsToken: ['ceased_direct_marketing', 'updated_preferences'],
      effectiveDate: new Date(),
    };
  }
}
```
