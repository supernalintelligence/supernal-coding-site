# COMP-GDPR-007: Right to Rectification

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data subject right to rectification implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 16 - Right to rectification  
**Category**: data-subject-rights, rectification  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Provides data subjects with the right to obtain rectification of inaccurate personal data and to have incomplete personal data completed.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Right to Rectification
  As a data subject
  I want to correct inaccurate personal data
  So that my information is accurate and up-to-date

  Background:
    Given rectification request procedures are established
    And data correction mechanisms are implemented
    And third-party notification processes are defined

  Scenario: Inaccurate Data Correction
    Given a data subject identifies inaccurate personal data
    When submitting a rectification request
    Then the accuracy of current data should be verified
    And corrections should be applied without undue delay
    And data subject should be notified of the correction

  Scenario: Incomplete Data Completion
    Given a data subject requests completion of incomplete data
    When processing the completion request
    Then the completeness of current data should be assessed
    And additional data should be added where appropriate
    And data subject should be confirmed of the completion

  Scenario: Third Party Notification
    Given personal data has been corrected
    When the data was previously shared with third parties
    Then all recipients should be notified of the correction
    And confirmation of third-party updates should be obtained
    And data subject should be informed of notification outcomes
```

## Technical Context

### Rectification Management System

```typescript
interface RectificationRequest {
  id: string;
  dataSubjectId: string;
  requestDate: Date;
  requestType: 'correction' | 'completion';
  dataFields: DataFieldCorrection[];
  justification: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'rejected';
  responseDeadline: Date;
}

interface DataFieldCorrection {
  fieldName: string;
  currentValue: any;
  proposedValue: any;
  correctionType: 'inaccurate' | 'incomplete' | 'outdated';
  evidence?: string;
}

class RectificationProcessor {
  async processRectificationRequest(
    request: RectificationRequest
  ): Promise<RectificationResponse> {
    // Verify the request
    const verification = await this.verifyRectificationRequest(request);
    if (!verification.valid) {
      return this.createRejectionResponse(request, verification.reason);
    }

    // Apply corrections
    const corrections = await this.applyCorrections(request.dataFields);

    // Notify third parties
    const notifications = await this.notifyThirdParties(
      request.dataSubjectId,
      corrections
    );

    // Update audit trail
    await this.logRectification(request, corrections, notifications);

    return {
      requestId: request.id,
      status: 'completed',
      correctionsApplied: corrections,
      thirdPartyNotifications: notifications,
      completedDate: new Date(),
    };
  }

  private async notifyThirdParties(
    dataSubjectId: string,
    corrections: AppliedCorrection[]
  ): Promise<ThirdPartyNotification[]> {
    const recipients = await this.getDataRecipients(dataSubjectId);

    return Promise.all(
      recipients.map((recipient) =>
        this.sendRectificationNotification(recipient, corrections)
      )
    );
  }
}
```
