# COMP-GDPR-009: Right to Data Portability

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data subject right to data portability implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 20 - Right to data portability  
**Category**: data-subject-rights, portability  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Provides data subjects with the right to receive personal data concerning them in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another controller.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Right to Data Portability
  As a data subject
  I want to receive my personal data in a portable format
  So that I can transmit it to another service provider

  Background:
    Given data portability procedures are established
    And export capabilities are implemented
    And data format standards are defined

  Scenario: Valid Portability Request
    Given a data subject submits a portability request
    When the request is processed
    Then identity should be verified
    And personal data should be exported in structured format
    And data should be provided in commonly used format (JSON, CSV, XML)
    And response should be provided within one month

  Scenario: Automated Data Export
    Given a data subject uses the self-service export portal
    When requesting data portability
    Then data should be compiled automatically
    And export should be available in multiple formats
    And download should be secure and time-limited

  Scenario: Direct Transmission
    Given a data subject requests direct transmission to another controller
    When transmission is technically feasible
    Then secure transmission should be initiated
    And confirmation should be provided to both parties
    And audit trail should be maintained
```

## Technical Context

### Data Export Framework

```typescript
interface PortabilityRequest {
  id: string;
  dataSubjectId: string;
  requestDate: Date;
  exportFormat: 'json' | 'csv' | 'xml';
  directTransmission: boolean;
  targetController?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
}

interface PortableDataPackage {
  metadata: {
    exportDate: Date;
    dataSubject: string;
    format: string;
    version: string;
  };
  personalData: Record<string, any>;
  processingHistory: ProcessingRecord[];
  consentRecords: ConsentRecord[];
  dataSchema: DataSchema;
}

class DataPortabilityService {
  async processPortabilityRequest(
    request: PortabilityRequest
  ): Promise<PortableDataPackage> {
    const personalData = await this.extractPortableData(request.dataSubjectId);
    const dataPackage = await this.formatForPortability(
      personalData,
      request.exportFormat
    );

    if (request.directTransmission && request.targetController) {
      await this.transmitToController(dataPackage, request.targetController);
    }

    return dataPackage;
  }

  private async extractPortableData(
    dataSubjectId: string
  ): Promise<PersonalDataSet> {
    // Only extract data provided by data subject or generated through automated processing
    return {
      providedData: await this.getDataProvidedBySubject(dataSubjectId),
      generatedData: await this.getAutomatedProcessingResults(dataSubjectId),
      // Exclude derived/inferred data that doesn't qualify for portability
    };
  }
}
```

## Definition of Done
