# COMP-GDPR-008: Right to Erasure

## Overview

**Purpose**: Right to be forgotten implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 17 - Right to Erasure  
**Category**: subject-rights, erasure  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Implements the right to erasure ("right to be forgotten") enabling data subjects to obtain deletion of their personal data under specified circumstances.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Right to Erasure Implementation Validation
  As a data protection officer
  I want to validate right to erasure implementation
  So that I can verify GDPR Article 17 compliance

  Background:
    Given a data processing system handles personal data
    And GDPR compliance is required
    And right to erasure functionality is implemented

  Scenario: Erasure Request Processing Validation
    Given an erasure request is received from a data subject
    When the request is processed
    And erasure grounds are verified
    And data deletion is executed
    Then the request shall be processed within one month
    And erasure grounds shall be properly assessed
    And personal data shall be deleted where grounds exist

  Scenario: Data Deletion Completeness Validation
    Given erasure request processing is complete
    When data deletion is verified
    And system-wide removal is confirmed
    And backup deletion is validated
    Then all personal data shall be deleted from active systems
    And data shall be removed from backups where technically feasible
    And data deletion shall be verifiable and auditable

  Scenario: Third Party Notification Validation
    Given personal data has been made public
    When erasure request is processed
    And third party controllers are identified
    And notification obligations are executed
    Then third party controllers shall be informed of erasure request
    And reasonable steps shall be taken to inform third parties
    And notification efforts shall be documented
```

## Technical Context

### Implementation Requirements

- **Request Processing**: Systematic processing of erasure requests within legal timeframes
- **Grounds Assessment**: Evaluation of legal grounds for erasure under Article 17
- **Data Identification**: Comprehensive identification of personal data for deletion
- **Deletion Execution**: Secure and complete deletion of identified data
- **Third Party Notification**: Notification to controllers who have received the data
- **Verification System**: Verification and audit trail of deletion activities

### System Architecture

```typescript
interface RightToErasureSystem {
  requestProcessor: ErasureRequestProcessor;
  groundsAssessment: ErasureGroundsAssessment;
  dataLocator: PersonalDataLocator;
  deletionEngine: SecureDeletionEngine;
  thirdPartyNotifier: ThirdPartyNotifier;
  auditTrail: ErasureAuditTrail;
}

interface ErasureRequest {
  requestId: string;
  dataSubjectId: string;
  requestDate: Date;
  erasureGrounds: ErasureGrounds[];
  dataCategories: DataCategory[];
  processingActivities: ProcessingActivity[];
  status: ErasureRequestStatus;
  completionDate?: Date;
}

interface ErasureGrounds {
  ground: ErasureGroundType;
  description: string;
  applicable: boolean;
  assessment: GroundsAssessment;
}

enum ErasureGroundType {
  NO_LONGER_NECESSARY = 'no_longer_necessary',
  CONSENT_WITHDRAWN = 'consent_withdrawn',
  UNLAWFUL_PROCESSING = 'unlawful_processing',
  LEGAL_OBLIGATION = 'legal_obligation',
  CHILD_CONSENT = 'child_consent',
  OBJECTION_UPHELD = 'objection_upheld',
}
```

### Validation Strategy

1. **Request Processing**: Verify timely and systematic processing of erasure requests
2. **Legal Assessment**: Validate proper assessment of erasure grounds
3. **Data Deletion**: Confirm complete and secure deletion of personal data
4. **Third Party Compliance**: Verify notification to third party controllers
5. **Audit Capability**: Ensure comprehensive audit trails for erasure activities

## Testing Strategy

### Functional Testing

- Erasure request submission and processing workflows
- Data identification and deletion processes
- Third party notification mechanisms
- Exception handling for retention obligations

### Technical Testing

- Data deletion completeness across all systems
- Backup and archive data handling
- Database referential integrity after deletion
- System performance during bulk deletions

### Compliance Testing

- Legal grounds assessment accuracy
- Timeframe compliance (one month response)
- Documentation and audit trail completeness
- Data subject communication requirements

## Compliance Evidence

### Required Documentation

- Right to Erasure Policy and Procedures
- Erasure request processing workflows
- Data mapping and identification procedures
- Secure deletion technical specifications
- Third party notification procedures
- Staff training records on erasure rights

### Audit Trail

- Erasure request records and processing logs
- Legal grounds assessment documentation
- Data deletion execution records and verification
- Third party notification records and responses
- Exception handling and retention justification records

## Related Requirements

- REQ-GDPR-001: Lawful Basis for Processing
- REQ-GDPR-006: Right of Access
- REQ-GDPR-007: Right to Rectification
- REQ-GDPR-010: Right to Object

_Note: Individual requirement template files are generated when using `sc init --framework=gdpr`_

## Usage Examples

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate this requirement
sc req new --template=REQ-GDPR-008 --title="Right to Erasure"

# Validate erasure implementation
sc req validate REQ-GDPR-008 --framework=gdpr

# Test erasure functionality
sc privacy test-erasure --data-subject=test-user-123
```

### Implementation Example

```javascript
// Right to erasure validation
const gdprValidator = new GDPRValidator();
const erasureSystem = await loadErasureSystem();

const erasureResult = await gdprValidator.validateErasureRights(erasureSystem, {
  requirement: 'REQ-GDPR-008',
  testRequestProcessing: true,
  testDataDeletion: true,
  testThirdPartyNotification: true,
  verifyAuditTrail: true,
});

if (erasureResult.isCompliant) {
  console.log('Right to erasure implementation compliant');
} else {
  console.log('Erasure implementation issues:', erasureResult.issues);
}
```
