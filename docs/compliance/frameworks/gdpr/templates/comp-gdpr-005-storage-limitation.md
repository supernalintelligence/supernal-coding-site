# COMP-GDPR-005: Storage Limitation

## Overview

**Purpose**: Storage limitation principle implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 5(1)(e) - Storage limitation  
**Category**: data-protection, retention  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Ensures personal data is kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Storage Limitation
  As a data controller
  I want to implement storage limitation controls
  So that personal data is not retained longer than necessary

  Background:
    Given retention policies are established for all data categories
    And automated deletion mechanisms are implemented
    And retention schedules are documented and approved

  Scenario: Automatic Data Deletion
    Given personal data with defined retention periods
    When retention period expires
    Then data should be automatically flagged for deletion
    And deletion should occur within defined timeframes
    And deletion should be logged for audit purposes

  Scenario: Retention Period Assessment
    Given a new data processing activity
    When defining retention requirements
    Then business necessity should be evaluated
    And legal requirements should be considered
    And minimum necessary retention period should be established

  Scenario: Data Subject Deletion Request
    Given a data subject requests deletion of their data
    When processing the deletion request
    Then retention obligations should be checked
    And data should be deleted where legally permissible
    And confirmation should be provided to the data subject
```

## Technical Context

### Retention Management System

```typescript
interface RetentionPolicy {
  dataCategory: string;
  purpose: string;
  retentionPeriod: string; // ISO 8601 duration
  legalBasis: string;
  deletionMethod: 'secure_delete' | 'anonymization' | 'pseudonymization';
  exceptions: RetentionException[];
}

interface RetentionException {
  reason: 'legal_hold' | 'ongoing_investigation' | 'active_contract';
  description: string;
  expiryDate?: Date;
  reviewDate: Date;
}

class RetentionManager {
  async scheduleRetention(
    data: PersonalDataRecord
  ): Promise<RetentionSchedule> {
    const policy = await this.getRetentionPolicy(data.category, data.purpose);
    const retentionDate = this.calculateRetentionDate(data.createdDate, policy);

    return {
      dataId: data.id,
      retentionDate,
      deletionMethod: policy.deletionMethod,
      scheduled: true,
      exceptions: await this.checkExceptions(data),
    };
  }

  async processExpiredData(): Promise<DeletionReport> {
    const expiredData = await this.getExpiredData();
    const deletionResults = await Promise.all(
      expiredData.map((data) => this.processDataDeletion(data))
    );

    return {
      totalProcessed: expiredData.length,
      successfulDeletions: deletionResults.filter((r) => r.success).length,
      failedDeletions: deletionResults.filter((r) => !r.success),
      auditTrail: deletionResults.map((r) => r.auditEntry),
    };
  }
}
```
