# COMP-GDPR-011: Privacy by Design

## Overview

**Purpose**: Privacy by design and by default implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 25 - Data protection by design and by default  
**Category**: privacy-engineering, design  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Implements privacy by design and by default principles, ensuring appropriate technical and organizational measures are integrated into processing activities and business practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Privacy by Design
  As a system architect
  I want to implement privacy by design principles
  So that privacy protection is built into all systems and processes

  Background:
    Given privacy by design policies are established
    And privacy engineering practices are implemented
    And privacy impact assessments are integrated into development

  Scenario: System Design Review
    Given a new system or feature is being designed
    When conducting design review
    Then privacy requirements should be identified
    And privacy-enhancing technologies should be considered
    And data minimization should be implemented by default

  Scenario: Default Privacy Settings
    Given a system collects personal data
    When users interact with the system
    Then most privacy-friendly settings should be default
    And users should have granular control over data processing
    And consent should be specific and informed
```

## Technical Context

### Privacy Engineering Framework

```typescript
interface PrivacyByDesignPrinciples {
  proactive: boolean; // Anticipate and prevent privacy invasions
  defaultProtection: boolean; // Privacy as the default setting
  fullFunctionality: boolean; // Accommodate all legitimate interests
  endToEndSecurity: boolean; // Secure data throughout lifecycle
  visibilityTransparency: boolean; // Ensure accountability and transparency
  respectUserPrivacy: boolean; // Keep user interests paramount
}

class PrivacyEngineeringToolkit {
  async assessPrivacyRequirements(
    systemDesign: SystemDesign
  ): Promise<PrivacyRequirements> {
    return {
      dataMinimization: await this.assessDataMinimization(systemDesign),
      purposeLimitation: await this.assessPurposeLimitation(systemDesign),
      storageMinimization: await this.assessStorageRequirements(systemDesign),
      accessControls: await this.assessAccessRequirements(systemDesign),
      encryptionNeeds: await this.assessEncryptionRequirements(systemDesign),
      anonymizationOpportunities:
        await this.identifyAnonymizationOptions(systemDesign),
    };
  }

  async implementPrivacyDefaults(
    system: System
  ): Promise<PrivacyConfiguration> {
    return {
      dataCollection: 'minimal',
      consentGranularity: 'specific',
      retentionPeriod: 'shortest_necessary',
      sharingDefault: 'disabled',
      profilingDefault: 'disabled',
      marketingDefault: 'opt_in_required',
    };
  }
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Privacy by design policy documented and approved
- [ ] Privacy engineering practices integrated into development lifecycle
- [ ] Privacy-enhancing technologies catalog established
- [ ] Default privacy settings implemented across all systems
- [ ] Privacy impact assessment integration completed
- [ ] Developer training on privacy engineering completed
- [ ] Privacy design review processes established
- [ ] Compliance validation performed and documented
