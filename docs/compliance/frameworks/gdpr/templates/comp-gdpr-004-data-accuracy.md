# COMP-GDPR-004: Data Accuracy

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data accuracy principle implementation  
**GDPR Article**: Article 5(1)(d) - Accuracy  
**Category**: data-protection, accuracy  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: GDPR

## Description

Ensures personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, with every reasonable step taken to ensure inaccurate personal data is erased or rectified without delay.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Data Accuracy
  As a data controller
  I want to maintain accurate personal data
  So that data subjects' rights are protected

  Background:
    Given data accuracy policies are established
    And data validation procedures are implemented
    And correction mechanisms are available

  Scenario: Data Validation on Collection
    Given new personal data is being collected
    When data is submitted to the system
    Then validation rules should be applied
    And invalid data should be rejected with clear error messages
    And data quality scores should be calculated

  Scenario: Automated Data Quality Monitoring
    Given existing personal data in the system
    When periodic data quality checks run
    Then accuracy metrics should be calculated
    And data quality issues should be flagged
    And correction workflows should be triggered for inaccurate data

  Scenario: Data Subject Correction Request
    Given a data subject requests correction of inaccurate data
    When the correction request is processed
    Then data accuracy should be verified
    And corrections should be applied within required timeframes
    And data subject should be notified of the outcome
```

## Technical Context

### Data Quality Framework

```typescript
interface DataQualityMetrics {
  completeness: number; // 0-1 scale
  accuracy: number; // 0-1 scale
  consistency: number; // 0-1 scale
  timeliness: number; // 0-1 scale
  validity: number; // 0-1 scale
  overallScore: number; // Weighted average
}

interface DataValidationRule {
  field: string;
  ruleType: 'format' | 'range' | 'reference' | 'business';
  rule: string;
  errorMessage: string;
  severity: 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
}

class DataAccuracyEngine {
  async validateData(data: PersonalDataRecord): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    const rules = await this.getValidationRules(data.dataType);
    const results = await Promise.all(
      rules.map((rule) => this.applyValidationRule(data, rule))
    );

    return {
      valid: results.every((r) => r.severity !== 'error'),
      errors: results.filter((r) => r.severity === 'error'),
      warnings: results.filter((r) => r.severity === 'warning'),
      qualityScore: this.calculateQualityScore(results),
    };
  }

  async monitorDataQuality(): Promise<DataQualityReport> {
    const datasets = await this.getPersonalDatasets();
    const qualityMetrics = await Promise.all(
      datasets.map((dataset) => this.assessDataQuality(dataset))
    );

    return {
      overallQuality: this.calculateOverallQuality(qualityMetrics),
      datasetMetrics: qualityMetrics,
      issuesFound: this.identifyQualityIssues(qualityMetrics),
      recommendedActions: this.generateRecommendations(qualityMetrics),
    };
  }
}
```
