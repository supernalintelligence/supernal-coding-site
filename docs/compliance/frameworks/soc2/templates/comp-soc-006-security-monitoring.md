# COMP-SOC-006: Security Monitoring

## Overview

**Purpose**: Continuous security monitoring and threat detection  
**TSC Reference**: CC7.2 - System Monitoring  
**Category**: security, monitoring  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Implements comprehensive security monitoring capabilities including log management, security information and event management (SIEM), and threat detection.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Security Monitoring
  As a service organization
  I want to implement security monitoring
  So that I can detect and respond to security threats

  Background:
    Given the organization operates critical systems
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And security monitoring policies are established

  Scenario: Log Collection and Analysis
    Given systems generate security-relevant logs
    When log collection is implemented
    Then logs shall be collected from all critical systems
    And logs shall be centralized in SIEM system
    And log integrity shall be protected
    And log retention shall meet compliance requirements

  Scenario: Threat Detection and Alerting
    Given security monitoring systems are operational
    When security events occur
    Then threats shall be detected using correlation rules
    And security alerts shall be generated for suspicious activities
    And alerts shall be prioritized based on risk level
    And incident response procedures shall be triggered

  Scenario: Security Monitoring Review
    Given security monitoring data is collected
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then monitoring effectiveness shall be assessed
    And detection rules shall be tuned and updated
    And false positive rates shall be minimized
    And monitoring coverage gaps shall be identified
```

## Technical Requirements

### Monitoring Infrastructure

- **SIEM Platform**: Centralized security information and event management
- **Log Management**: Secure log collection, storage, and analysis
- **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- **Alerting**: Real-time security alert generation and notification

### Monitoring Scope

- **Network Security**: Firewall, IDS/IPS, and network traffic monitoring
- **System Security**: Operating system and application security events
- **Access Control**: Authentication, authorization, and privileged access
- **Data Protection**: Data access, modification, and exfiltration monitoring

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **CC7.2**: The entity monitors system components and the operation of controls
- **CC7.3**: The entity evaluates security events to identify (if any) security incidents

### Implementation Evidence

- Security monitoring policy documentation
- SIEM system configuration and rules
- Security monitoring procedures
- Incident detection and response logs
- Monitoring effectiveness reports
- Threat intelligence integration documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Detection Rule Testing**: Validate security detection capabilities
- **Alert Testing**: Verify alerting mechanisms and notifications
- **Log Integrity Testing**: Ensure log collection and integrity

### Manual Testing

- **Monitoring Review**: Manual assessment of monitoring effectiveness
- **Incident Simulation**: Test incident detection and response
- **Coverage Assessment**: Evaluate monitoring scope and coverage

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example SIEM log forwarding
rsyslog configuration for centralized logging
splunk forwarder configuration
elastic beats configuration

# Security monitoring validation
tail -f /var/log/security
journalctl -u siem-agent -f
```

### Configuration Requirements

- **Log Sources**: All critical systems and applications
- **Retention**: Minimum 1 year log retention for compliance
- **Alerting**: 24/7 security operations center (SOC) monitoring
- **Integration**: Incident response and ticketing system integration

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Security monitoring policy documented and approved
- [ ] SIEM system deployed and configured
- [ ] Log collection implemented for all critical systems
- [ ] Security detection rules configured and tested
- [ ] Alerting and notification procedures established
- [ ] Security monitoring procedures documented
- [ ] Staff training completed on monitoring procedures
- [ ] Monitoring effectiveness validated and documented

## Traceability

- **Policy Documents**: Security Monitoring Policy
- **Procedures**: MON-001 through MON-012
- **Technical Controls**: SIEM and log management systems
- **Monitoring**: Security operations center dashboards
- **Reports**: Monthly security monitoring reports
