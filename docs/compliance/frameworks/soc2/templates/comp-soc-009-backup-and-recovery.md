# COMP-SOC-009: Backup and Recovery

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data backup and disaster recovery capabilities  
**TSC Reference**: A1.3 - System Recovery  
**Category**: availability, backup-recovery  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Establishes comprehensive backup and recovery procedures to ensure business continuity and data protection in case of system failures or disasters.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Backup and Recovery
  As a service organization
  I want to implement backup and recovery procedures
  So that I can restore operations after system failures

  Background:
    Given the organization processes critical business data
    And business continuity is required
    And backup and recovery policies are established

  Scenario: Data Backup Implementation
    Given critical data exists in systems
    When backup procedures are executed
    Then data shall be backed up according to schedule
    And backup integrity shall be verified
    And backups shall be stored securely
    And backup retention shall meet business requirements

  Scenario: Disaster Recovery Testing
    Given backup and recovery procedures exist
    When disaster recovery tests are performed
    Then recovery procedures shall be executed successfully
    And recovery time objectives (RTO) shall be met
    And recovery point objectives (RPO) shall be achieved
    And test results shall be documented and reviewed
```

## Technical Requirements

### Backup Strategy

- **Full Backups**: Complete system and data backups
- **Incremental Backups**: Changed data backup procedures
- **Offsite Storage**: Geographically separated backup storage
- **Encryption**: Backup data encryption and protection

### Recovery Procedures

- **Recovery Testing**: Regular disaster recovery testing
- **Documentation**: Detailed recovery procedures
- **RTO/RPO**: Defined recovery time and point objectives
- **Communication**: Disaster recovery communication plans

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Backup and recovery policy documented
- [ ] Backup procedures implemented and automated
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Backup monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Staff training on recovery procedures completed
