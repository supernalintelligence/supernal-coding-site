# COMP-SOC-013: Data Validation Controls

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data validation and integrity controls  
**TSC Reference**: PI1.4 - Data Input, Processing, and Output Integrity  
**Category**: processing-integrity, data-validation  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Implements comprehensive data validation controls to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and completeness throughout data input, processing, and output operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Data Validation Controls
  As a service organization
  I want to implement data validation controls
  So that I can ensure data integrity and meet processing integrity requirements

  Background:
    Given the organization processes customer and business data
    And SOC 2 processing integrity criteria apply
    And data validation policies are established

  Scenario: Input Data Validation
    Given data is received from external sources
    When data input validation is performed
    Then data format shall be validated against defined schemas
    And data ranges and constraints shall be enforced
    And required fields shall be verified for completeness
    And invalid data shall be rejected with appropriate error messages
    And validation results shall be logged for audit purposes

  Scenario: Data Processing Validation
    Given data is being processed by system components
    When data processing occurs
    Then data transformations shall maintain referential integrity
    And business rule validation shall be applied consistently
    And data calculations shall be verified for accuracy
    And processing errors shall be detected and handled appropriately
    And data lineage shall be maintained throughout processing

  Scenario: Output Data Validation
    Given processed data is being output from systems
    When data output validation is performed
    Then output data shall be validated against expected formats
    And data completeness shall be verified before transmission
    And output integrity checks shall be performed
    And data reconciliation shall be conducted where applicable
    And output validation results shall be documented

  Scenario: Data Quality Monitoring
    Given data validation controls are operational
    When data quality monitoring is performed
    Then data quality metrics shall be collected and analyzed
    And data validation failures shall be tracked and reported
    And data quality trends shall be monitored over time
    And data quality issues shall trigger corrective actions
    And data quality reports shall be generated regularly

  Scenario: Data Validation Error Handling
    Given data validation errors are detected
    When error handling procedures are executed
    Then validation errors shall be classified by severity
    And error notifications shall be sent to appropriate personnel
    And error correction procedures shall be initiated
    And error resolution shall be tracked and documented
    And recurring errors shall be analyzed for root cause
```

## Technical Requirements

### Input Validation Controls

- **Schema Validation**: JSON/XML schema validation for structured data
- **Data Type Validation**: Strong typing and format validation
- **Range Validation**: Numeric ranges, date ranges, and length constraints
- **Business Rule Validation**: Custom validation rules for business logic
- **Sanitization**: Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

### Processing Validation Controls

- **Transaction Integrity**: ACID compliance for database transactions
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and relationship validation
- **Calculation Validation**: Mathematical operation verification
- **State Validation**: Business process state transition validation
- **Concurrency Control**: Multi-user data access conflict resolution

### Output Validation Controls

- **Format Validation**: Output format compliance verification
- **Completeness Checks**: Data completeness validation before output
- **Reconciliation**: Input vs. output data reconciliation
- **Checksum Validation**: Data integrity verification using checksums
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic validation of data authenticity

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **PI1.4**: The entity implements controls to provide reasonable assurance that system inputs, data processing, and system outputs are complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized
- **PI1.1**: The entity obtains or generates, uses, and communicates relevant, quality information to support the functioning of internal control
- **CC6.8**: The entity implements controls to prevent or detect and act upon the introduction of unauthorized or malicious software

### Implementation Evidence

- Data validation policy documentation
- Input validation procedures and controls
- Data processing validation rules and logic
- Output validation and reconciliation procedures
- Data quality monitoring reports
- Validation error logs and resolution tracking
- Data integrity testing results

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Input Validation Testing**: Automated testing of input validation rules
- **Data Processing Testing**: Unit and integration testing of data processing logic
- **Output Validation Testing**: Automated verification of output data integrity
- **Performance Testing**: Validation performance under load conditions

### Manual Testing

- **Business Rule Testing**: Manual validation of complex business rules
- **Edge Case Testing**: Testing of boundary conditions and edge cases
- **Error Handling Testing**: Manual testing of error handling procedures
- **User Acceptance Testing**: End-user validation of data processing accuracy

### Data Quality Testing

- **Data Profiling**: Analysis of data quality characteristics
- **Data Completeness Testing**: Verification of data completeness requirements
- **Data Accuracy Testing**: Validation of data accuracy against source systems
- **Data Consistency Testing**: Cross-system data consistency verification

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example data validation implementations

# JSON Schema validation (Node.js)
const Ajv = require('ajv');
const ajv = new Ajv();
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    email: { type: "string", format: "email" },
    age: { type: "integer", minimum: 0, maximum: 120 }
  },
  required: ["email", "age"]
};
const validate = ajv.compile(schema);

# SQL data validation constraints
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT check_email
  CHECK (email ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$');
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT check_amount
  CHECK (amount > 0 AND amount <= 1000000);

# Python data validation example
from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, validator
class UserModel(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    age: int

    @validator('age')
    def validate_age(cls, v):
        if v < 0 or v > 120:
            raise ValueError('Age must be between 0 and 120')
        return v

# Data quality monitoring
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN email IS NULL THEN 1 END) as missing_emails,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN age < 0 OR age > 120 THEN 1 END) as invalid_ages
FROM users;
```

### Validation Rules Framework

- **Field-Level Validation**: Individual field validation rules
- **Record-Level Validation**: Cross-field validation within records
- **Batch-Level Validation**: Aggregate validation across record sets
- **Business Rule Validation**: Complex business logic validation
- **Temporal Validation**: Time-based validation rules

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Validation Error Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low severity levels
