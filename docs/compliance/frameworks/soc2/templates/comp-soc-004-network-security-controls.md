# COMP-SOC-004: Network Security Controls

## Overview

**Purpose**: Network protection and segmentation  
**TSC Reference**: CC6.1 - Logical and Physical Access Controls  
**Category**: security, network  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Establishes network security controls including firewalls, network segmentation, intrusion detection, and secure network configurations.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Network Security Controls
  As a service organization
  I want to implement network security controls
  So that I can protect systems and data from network-based threats

  Background:
    Given the organization operates networked systems
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And network security policies are established

  Scenario: Firewall Configuration
    Given network infrastructure exists
    When firewall rules are configured
    Then default deny policy shall be implemented
    And only necessary ports and protocols shall be allowed
    And firewall rules shall be documented and approved
    And regular firewall rule reviews shall be conducted

  Scenario: Network Segmentation
    Given multiple network zones exist
    When network segmentation is implemented
    Then sensitive systems shall be isolated from general networks
    And inter-zone traffic shall be controlled and monitored
    And network access controls shall enforce business requirements
    And segmentation effectiveness shall be tested regularly

  Scenario: Intrusion Detection
    Given network monitoring systems are deployed
    When network traffic is analyzed
    Then suspicious activities shall be detected and alerted
    And intrusion attempts shall be logged and investigated
    And detection rules shall be updated regularly
    And incident response procedures shall be followed
```

## Technical Requirements

### Network Architecture

- **Perimeter Security**: Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems
- **Network Segmentation**: DMZ, internal networks, and secure zones
- **Access Control**: Network access control (NAC) implementation
- **Monitoring**: Network traffic analysis and intrusion detection

### Security Controls

- **Firewall Management**: Centralized firewall rule management
- **VPN Security**: Secure remote access with strong authentication
- **Wireless Security**: WPA3 encryption and enterprise authentication
- **Network Monitoring**: 24/7 network security monitoring

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **CC6.1**: The entity implements logical access security measures
- **CC7.2**: The entity monitors system components and the operation of controls

### Implementation Evidence

- Network architecture diagrams
- Firewall configuration documentation
- Network segmentation policies
- Intrusion detection system logs
- Network security monitoring reports
- Vulnerability assessment results

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Network Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Penetration Testing**: External and internal network testing
- **Configuration Compliance**: Automated security configuration checks

### Manual Testing

- **Firewall Rule Review**: Manual validation of firewall configurations
- **Network Architecture Review**: Assessment of network segmentation
- **Incident Response Testing**: Network security incident simulations

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example firewall rule validation
iptables -L -n -v
ufw status verbose

# Network segmentation verification
ip route show
netstat -rn

# Intrusion detection monitoring
tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
journalctl -u snort -f
```

### Configuration Requirements

- **SIEM Integration**: Network security event correlation
- **Asset Management**: Network device inventory and monitoring
- **Change Management**: Network configuration change controls
- **Backup and Recovery**: Network configuration backup procedures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Network security policy documented and approved
- [ ] Firewall rules configured and documented
- [ ] Network segmentation implemented and tested
- [ ] Intrusion detection system deployed and configured
- [ ] Network monitoring procedures established
- [ ] Staff training completed on network security procedures
- [ ] Regular security assessments scheduled
- [ ] Compliance evidence collected and documented

## Traceability

- **Policy Documents**: Network Security Policy
- **Procedures**: NET-001 through NET-010
- **Technical Controls**: Firewall and IDS/IPS systems
- **Monitoring**: Network security monitoring dashboards
- **Assessments**: Quarterly network security assessments
