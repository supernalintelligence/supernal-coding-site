# COMP-SOC-011: Change Management

## Overview

**Purpose**: Systematic change management and configuration control  
**TSC Reference**: CC8.1 - Change Management and Configuration Control  
**Category**: security, change-management  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Implements comprehensive change management controls to ensure all changes to systems, applications, and infrastructure are authorized, tested, documented, and implemented in a controlled manner.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Change Management
  As a service organization
  I want to implement change management
  So that I can control system changes and maintain security and availability

  Background:
    Given the organization operates critical systems
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And change management policies are established

  Scenario: Change Request and Authorization
    Given a system change is needed
    When a change request is submitted
    Then change request shall include business justification
    And technical impact assessment shall be performed
    And change shall be categorized by risk level (Emergency, High, Medium, Low)
    And appropriate approval shall be obtained based on change category
    And change timeline shall be established and communicated

  Scenario: Change Planning and Testing
    Given a change request has been approved
    When change implementation is planned
    Then detailed implementation plan shall be created
    And rollback procedures shall be documented
    And change shall be tested in non-production environment
    And test results shall be documented and approved
    And implementation window shall be scheduled

  Scenario: Change Implementation and Verification
    Given change implementation is scheduled
    When change is implemented
    Then implementation shall follow approved procedures
    And change progress shall be monitored and documented
    And post-implementation testing shall be performed
    And change success criteria shall be verified
    And stakeholders shall be notified of completion

  Scenario: Emergency Change Management
    Given an emergency change is required
    When emergency procedures are invoked
    Then emergency change authority shall approve the change
    And abbreviated testing shall be performed where possible
    And implementation shall be closely monitored
    And post-implementation review shall be conducted within 24 hours
    And emergency change shall be documented retroactively

  Scenario: Change Documentation and Audit Trail
    Given changes are implemented
    When change records are maintained
    Then complete change history shall be documented
    And configuration baselines shall be updated
    And change audit trail shall be maintained
    And change metrics shall be collected and reported
    And lessons learned shall be captured and shared
```

## Technical Requirements

### Change Management Process

- **Change Advisory Board (CAB)**: Multi-disciplinary change approval body
- **Change Categories**: Emergency, High, Medium, Low risk classifications
- **Approval Matrix**: Risk-based approval authority matrix
- **Change Calendar**: Coordinated change scheduling and blackout periods

### Change Control System

- **Change Tracking**: Centralized change request and tracking system
- **Workflow Management**: Automated change approval workflows
- **Configuration Management**: Baseline configuration tracking
- **Integration**: Integration with deployment and monitoring tools

### Testing and Validation

- **Test Environments**: Dedicated non-production testing environments
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- **Rollback Procedures**: Automated and manual rollback capabilities
- **Verification Testing**: Post-implementation validation procedures

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **CC8.1**: The entity authorizes, designs, develops or acquires, configures, documents, tests, approves, and implements changes to infrastructure, data, software, and procedures
- **CC6.1**: The entity implements logical access security measures to protect against threats
- **CC7.1**: The entity uses detection and monitoring procedures to identify security incidents

### Implementation Evidence

- Change management policy documentation
- Change request and approval records
- Change implementation procedures
- Testing and validation documentation
- Emergency change procedures and records
- Configuration management baselines
- Change metrics and reporting

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Change Validation**: Automated testing of change implementations
- **Configuration Drift**: Automated detection of unauthorized changes
- **Deployment Testing**: Continuous integration and deployment validation
- **Rollback Testing**: Automated rollback procedure validation

### Manual Testing

- **Change Process Review**: Manual assessment of change procedures
- **Approval Process Testing**: Validation of change approval workflows
- **Emergency Procedures**: Testing of emergency change procedures
- **Documentation Review**: Manual review of change documentation

### Compliance Testing

- **Change Audit**: Regular audit of change management compliance
- **Process Effectiveness**: Assessment of change management effectiveness
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of change-related risks and controls
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Collection of change process feedback

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example change management tools and commands

# Git-based change tracking
git log --oneline --since="1 month ago" --grep="CHANGE-"
git tag -l "release-*" | sort -V | tail -5

# Configuration management
ansible-playbook --check site.yml  # Dry run
terraform plan  # Infrastructure change preview
kubectl diff -f deployment.yaml  # Kubernetes change preview

# Change deployment
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit production
terraform apply -auto-approve
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Change verification
curl -s http://healthcheck.example.com/status
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp
systemctl status myservice

# Rollback procedures
kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.web -refresh=false
ansible-playbook rollback.yml --limit production
```

### Change Categories and Approval

- **Emergency Changes**: CTO/CISO approval, implement first, document later
- **High Risk Changes**: CAB approval, full testing, scheduled maintenance window
- **Medium Risk Changes**: Technical lead approval, standard testing, coordinated deployment
- **Low Risk Changes**: Peer review, automated testing, continuous deployment

### Configuration Management

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in version-controlled code
- **Application Configuration**: Centralized configuration management
- **Database Changes**: Version-controlled database schema migrations
- **Security Configuration**: Baseline security configurations and drift detection
