# COMP-SOC-012: Capacity Management

## Overview

**Purpose**: Capacity management and performance monitoring  
**TSC Reference**: A1.1 - Capacity Planning and Performance Monitoring  
**Category**: availability, capacity-management  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Implements comprehensive capacity management controls to ensure systems can meet current and future availability commitments through proactive capacity planning, monitoring, and scaling.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Capacity Management
  As a service organization
  I want to implement capacity management
  So that I can meet availability commitments and prevent capacity-related outages

  Background:
    Given the organization provides services with availability commitments
    And SOC 2 availability criteria apply
    And capacity management policies are established

  Scenario: Capacity Planning and Forecasting
    Given business growth projections exist
    When capacity planning is performed
    Then current capacity utilization shall be assessed
    And future capacity needs shall be forecasted based on growth trends
    And capacity requirements shall be documented and approved
    And capacity procurement timelines shall be established

  Scenario: Real-time Capacity Monitoring
    Given systems are operational
    When capacity monitoring is active
    Then CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization shall be monitored continuously
    And capacity metrics shall be collected and stored
    And capacity trends shall be analyzed and reported
    And monitoring data shall be retained for capacity planning

  Scenario: Capacity Threshold Management
    Given capacity thresholds are defined
    When system utilization approaches thresholds
    Then warning alerts shall be generated at 70% capacity
    And critical alerts shall be generated at 85% capacity
    And emergency alerts shall be generated at 95% capacity
    And escalation procedures shall be triggered automatically

  Scenario: Automated Scaling Response
    Given auto-scaling policies are configured
    When capacity thresholds are exceeded
    Then horizontal scaling shall be triggered automatically
    And vertical scaling shall be applied when appropriate
    And scaling actions shall be logged and monitored
    And scaling effectiveness shall be validated

  Scenario: Capacity Performance Testing
    Given capacity limits need validation
    When performance testing is conducted
    Then load testing shall validate capacity assumptions
    And stress testing shall identify breaking points
    And performance benchmarks shall be established
    And test results shall inform capacity planning
```

## Technical Requirements

### Capacity Monitoring Infrastructure

- **Monitoring Tools**: Comprehensive system and application monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**: CPU, memory, storage, network, and application metrics
- **Data Retention**: Minimum 2 years of capacity data for trend analysis
- **Alerting**: Multi-tier alerting with escalation procedures

### Capacity Planning Process

- **Forecasting Models**: Statistical models for capacity prediction
- **Growth Analysis**: Business growth impact on capacity requirements
- **Procurement Planning**: Lead time management for capacity additions
- **Budget Planning**: Capacity-related budget forecasting and approval

### Auto-scaling Implementation

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Automatic instance/container scaling
- **Vertical Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation adjustment
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution across scaled resources
- **Scaling Policies**: Rule-based and predictive scaling algorithms

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **A1.1**: The entity maintains, monitors, and evaluates current processing capacity
- **A1.2**: The entity authorizes, designs, develops or acquires, implements, operates, approves, and monitors environmental protections, software, data back-up processes, and recovery infrastructure
- **CC7.1**: The entity uses detection and monitoring procedures to identify system capacity issues

### Implementation Evidence

- Capacity management policy documentation
- Capacity planning procedures and forecasts
- Capacity monitoring system configuration
- Historical capacity utilization reports
- Scaling policy documentation and logs
- Performance testing reports and results
- Capacity-related incident reports and resolutions

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Capacity Monitoring Tests**: Verify monitoring system accuracy and coverage
- **Scaling Tests**: Validate auto-scaling functionality and policies
- **Performance Tests**: Automated load and stress testing
- **Alerting Tests**: Verify capacity alert generation and delivery

### Manual Testing

- **Capacity Planning Review**: Manual validation of capacity forecasts
- **Scaling Procedure Testing**: Manual execution of scaling procedures
- **Performance Analysis**: Manual review of performance test results
- **Incident Response Testing**: Capacity-related incident simulations

### Load Testing

- **Baseline Testing**: Establish performance baselines under normal load
- **Peak Load Testing**: Validate capacity under maximum expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Identify system breaking points and failure modes
- **Endurance Testing**: Long-term capacity sustainability validation

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example capacity monitoring setup
# CPU and memory monitoring
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d'%' -f1
free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "Memory Usage: %s/%sMB (%.2f%%)\n", $3,$2,$3*100/$2 }'

# Disk space monitoring
df -h | awk '$NF=="/"{printf "Disk Usage: %d/%dGB (%s)\n", $3,$2,$5}'

# Network monitoring
iftop -t -s 10 -L 10

# Application-specific monitoring
curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep -E "(cpu|memory|requests)"

# Auto-scaling configuration example (Kubernetes)
kubectl autoscale deployment webapp --cpu-percent=70 --min=2 --max=10

# Load testing example
ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://example.com/
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://example.com/
```

### Configuration Requirements

- **Monitoring Platform**: Enterprise monitoring solution (Prometheus, DataDog, etc.)
- **Auto-scaling**: Container orchestration or cloud auto-scaling services
- **Load Testing**: Performance testing tools and environments
- **Alerting**: Integration with incident management and notification systems
