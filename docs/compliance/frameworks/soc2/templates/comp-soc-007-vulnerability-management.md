# COMP-SOC-007: Vulnerability Management

## Overview

**Purpose**: Systematic vulnerability identification and remediation  
**TSC Reference**: CC7.1 - System Operations  
**Category**: security, vulnerability-management  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Establishes vulnerability management processes including vulnerability scanning, assessment, prioritization, and remediation to maintain system security.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Vulnerability Management
  As a service organization
  I want to implement vulnerability management
  So that I can identify and remediate security vulnerabilities

  Background:
    Given the organization operates systems with potential vulnerabilities
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And vulnerability management policies are established

  Scenario: Vulnerability Scanning
    Given systems are deployed in the environment
    When vulnerability scans are performed
    Then all systems shall be scanned regularly
    And vulnerability scan results shall be collected and analyzed
    And scan coverage shall include all network-accessible systems
    And scanning shall not disrupt business operations

  Scenario: Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization
    Given vulnerability scan results are available
    When vulnerabilities are assessed
    Then vulnerabilities shall be classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    And business impact shall be evaluated
    And remediation timelines shall be established based on risk
    And vulnerability tracking shall be maintained

  Scenario: Vulnerability Remediation
    Given vulnerabilities have been identified and prioritized
    When remediation activities are performed
    Then critical vulnerabilities shall be remediated within 72 hours
    And high vulnerabilities shall be remediated within 30 days
    And remediation shall be verified through re-scanning
    And remediation status shall be tracked and reported
```

## Technical Requirements

### Vulnerability Management Process

- **Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning tools
- **Assessment**: Risk-based vulnerability assessment
- **Prioritization**: Business impact and exploitability analysis
- **Remediation**: Systematic vulnerability remediation process

### Scanning Coverage

- **Network Scanning**: External and internal network vulnerability scans
- **Application Scanning**: Web application security testing
- **Configuration Scanning**: Security configuration assessments
- **Compliance Scanning**: Regulatory compliance validation

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **CC7.1**: The entity uses detection and monitoring procedures to identify (if any) security incidents
- **CC8.1**: The entity authorizes, designs, develops or acquires, configures, documents, tests, approves, and implements changes to infrastructure, data, software, and procedures

### Implementation Evidence

- Vulnerability management policy documentation
- Vulnerability scanning procedures and schedules
- Vulnerability assessment and prioritization criteria
- Remediation tracking and reporting
- Vulnerability scan reports and remediation evidence
- Penetration testing reports

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Scan Validation**: Verify vulnerability scanning coverage and accuracy
- **Remediation Testing**: Automated verification of vulnerability fixes
- **Compliance Testing**: Validate remediation timeline compliance

### Manual Testing

- **Process Review**: Manual assessment of vulnerability management procedures
- **Penetration Testing**: External security testing and validation
- **Remediation Verification**: Manual verification of critical vulnerability fixes

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example vulnerability scanning
nmap -sV -sC target_system
nessus_scan --target network_range
owasp-zap -cmd -quickurl https://target-app.com

# Vulnerability tracking
vuln_tracker --list --severity critical
patch_status --system all --pending
```

### Configuration Requirements

- **Scanning Tools**: Enterprise vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Qualys, etc.)
- **Patch Management**: Automated patch deployment systems
- **Asset Management**: Complete asset inventory for scan targeting
- **Reporting**: Vulnerability management dashboards and reports

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Vulnerability management policy documented and approved
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning tools deployed and configured
- [ ] Scanning schedules established for all system types
- [ ] Vulnerability assessment and prioritization procedures defined
- [ ] Remediation timelines and procedures established
- [ ] Vulnerability tracking system implemented
- [ ] Staff training completed on vulnerability management
- [ ] Regular vulnerability reporting implemented

## Traceability

- **Policy Documents**: Vulnerability Management Policy
- **Procedures**: VUL-001 through VUL-010
- **Technical Controls**: Vulnerability scanning and patch management systems
- **Tracking**: Vulnerability management dashboards
- **Reports**: Monthly vulnerability management reports
