# COMP-SOC-002: Multi-Factor Authentication

## Overview

**Purpose**: MFA implementation and enforcement  
**TSC Reference**: CC6.1 - Logical and Physical Access Controls  
**Category**: security, authentication  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Establishes multi-factor authentication requirements for all user access to systems containing sensitive data or performing critical functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Factor Authentication System Validation
  As a security auditor
  I want to validate MFA implementation
  So that I can verify SOC 2 security control compliance

  Background:
    Given a multi-factor authentication system is implemented
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And MFA validation testing is being conducted

  Scenario: MFA Enforcement Validation
    Given MFA policies are configured
    When user authentication is tested
    And access attempts are monitored
    And policy enforcement is verified
    Then MFA shall be required for all privileged accounts
    And MFA shall be enforced for sensitive system access
    And MFA bypass shall not be possible without proper authorization

  Scenario: Authentication Factor Validation
    Given multiple authentication factors are implemented
    When factor types are verified
    And factor independence is tested
    And factor security is assessed
    Then at least two different factor types shall be required
    And factors shall be independent of each other
    And factors shall meet security strength requirements

  Scenario: MFA System Reliability Validation
    Given MFA system availability requirements exist
    When system uptime is measured
    And backup authentication methods are tested
    And recovery procedures are verified
    Then MFA system shall meet availability requirements
    And backup authentication methods shall be available
    And MFA system recovery shall be tested and documented
```

## Technical Context

### Implementation Requirements

- **MFA Policy**: Comprehensive policy defining MFA requirements and scope
- **Authentication Factors**: Implementation of multiple independent authentication factors
- **Factor Types**: Support for knowledge, possession, and inherence factors
- **Policy Enforcement**: Technical controls to enforce MFA requirements
- **Backup Methods**: Alternative authentication methods for system failures
- **Monitoring System**: Continuous monitoring of MFA effectiveness and usage

### System Architecture

```typescript
interface MultiFactorAuthSystem {
  authenticationPolicy: MFAPolicy;
  factorProviders: AuthenticationFactor[];
  policyEnforcement: PolicyEnforcementEngine;
  backupMethods: BackupAuthMethod[];
  monitoringSystem: AuthenticationMonitoring;
  auditTrail: AuthenticationAuditTrail;
}

interface AuthenticationFactor {
  factorId: string;
  factorType: FactorType;
  provider: AuthProvider;
  securityLevel: SecurityLevel;
  configuration: FactorConfiguration;
  status: FactorStatus;
}

enum FactorType {
  KNOWLEDGE = 'knowledge', // Something you know (password, PIN)
  POSSESSION = 'possession', // Something you have (token, phone)
  INHERENCE = 'inherence', // Something you are (biometric)
}

interface MFAPolicy {
  scope: PolicyScope[];
  requiredFactors: number;
  factorTypes: FactorType[];
  exemptions: PolicyExemption[];
  enforcementRules: EnforcementRule[];
}
```

### Validation Strategy

1. **Policy Compliance**: Verify MFA policy implementation and enforcement
2. **Factor Security**: Validate authentication factor security and independence
3. **System Integration**: Test MFA integration with all relevant systems
4. **Reliability Testing**: Verify MFA system availability and backup methods
5. **User Experience**: Assess MFA usability and support processes

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing

- Authentication factor bypass attempts
- MFA system penetration testing
- Session management security validation
- Credential theft and replay attack testing

### Functional Testing

- MFA enrollment and configuration workflows
- Authentication factor validation processes
- Backup authentication method testing
- System integration and compatibility testing

### Reliability Testing

- MFA system availability and performance testing
- Failover and recovery procedure validation
- Load testing under peak usage conditions
- Disaster recovery testing for MFA systems

## Implementation Notes

_Note: Individual requirement template files are generated when using `sc init --framework=soc2`_

## Usage Examples

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate this requirement
sc req new --template=REQ-SOC-002 --title="Multi-Factor Authentication"

# Validate MFA implementation
sc req validate REQ-SOC-002 --framework=soc2

# Test MFA system effectiveness
sc soc2 test-mfa --requirement=REQ-SOC-002 --comprehensive
```

### Implementation Example

```javascript
// MFA system validation
const soc2Validator = new SOC2Validator();
const mfaSystem = await loadMFASystem();

const mfaResult = await soc2Validator.validateMFA(mfaSystem, {
  requirement: 'REQ-SOC-002',
  testPolicyEnforcement: true,
  testFactorSecurity: true,
  testSystemReliability: true,
  validateBackupMethods: true,
});

if (mfaResult.isCompliant) {
  console.log('MFA system compliant with SOC 2 requirements');
} else {
  console.log('MFA implementation issues:', mfaResult.issues);
}
```
