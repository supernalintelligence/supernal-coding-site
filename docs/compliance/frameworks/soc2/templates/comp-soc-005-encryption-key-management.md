# COMP-SOC-005: Encryption Key Management

## Overview

**Purpose**: Data protection through encryption  
**TSC Reference**: CC6.1 - Logical and Physical Access Controls  
**Category**: security, encryption  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Establishes encryption key management controls for protecting sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption methods.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Encryption Key Management
  As a service organization
  I want to implement encryption key management
  So that I can protect sensitive data through cryptographic controls

  Background:
    Given the organization processes sensitive data
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And encryption policies are established

  Scenario: Data Encryption at Rest
    Given sensitive data is stored in systems
    When data encryption is implemented
    Then data shall be encrypted using approved algorithms (AES-256)
    And encryption keys shall be managed securely
    And encrypted data shall be protected from unauthorized access
    And encryption implementation shall be validated regularly

  Scenario: Data Encryption in Transit
    Given data is transmitted between systems
    When data transmission occurs
    Then data shall be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher
    And secure communication protocols shall be enforced
    And certificate management shall be implemented
    And transmission security shall be monitored

  Scenario: Key Management Lifecycle
    Given encryption keys are used for data protection
    When key management operations are performed
    Then keys shall be generated using secure random methods
    And keys shall be stored in secure key management systems
    And key rotation shall be performed according to policy
    And key access shall be logged and monitored
```

## Technical Requirements

### Encryption Standards

- **Algorithms**: AES-256 for symmetric encryption, RSA-2048+ for asymmetric
- **Protocols**: TLS 1.2/1.3 for data in transit
- **Key Length**: Minimum key lengths per industry standards
- **Validation**: FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or equivalent validation

### Key Management

- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random key generation
- **Storage**: Hardware security modules (HSM) or secure key vaults
- **Distribution**: Secure key distribution mechanisms
- **Rotation**: Regular key rotation based on risk assessment

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **CC6.1**: Logical access security measures
- **CC6.7**: Data transmission and disposal controls

### Implementation Evidence

- Encryption policy documentation
- Key management procedures
- Cryptographic algorithm inventory
- Key rotation schedules and logs
- Encryption implementation validation reports
- Certificate management documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Encryption Validation**: Verify encryption implementation
- **Key Rotation Testing**: Automated key rotation procedures
- **Certificate Monitoring**: SSL/TLS certificate expiration monitoring

### Manual Testing

- **Cryptographic Review**: Manual review of encryption implementations
- **Key Management Audit**: Assessment of key management procedures
- **Compliance Testing**: Validation against encryption standards

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example encryption verification
openssl version
cryptsetup status /dev/mapper/encrypted_volume

# TLS configuration check
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1_2
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 example.com

# Key management validation
vault status
vault audit list
```

### Configuration Requirements
