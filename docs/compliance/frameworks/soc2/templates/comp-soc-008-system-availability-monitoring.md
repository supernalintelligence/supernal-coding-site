# COMP-SOC-008: System Availability Monitoring

## Overview

**Purpose**: System availability and performance monitoring  
**TSC Reference**: A1.2 - System Availability  
**Category**: availability, monitoring  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Implements system availability monitoring to ensure systems meet defined availability commitments and service level agreements.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: System Availability Monitoring
  As a service organization
  I want to monitor system availability
  So that I can meet availability commitments to customers

  Background:
    Given the organization provides services with availability commitments
    And SOC 2 availability criteria apply
    And availability monitoring is required

  Scenario: Availability Monitoring Implementation
    Given critical systems are identified
    When availability monitoring is configured
    Then system uptime shall be monitored continuously
    And availability metrics shall be collected and reported
    And availability thresholds shall trigger alerts
    And monitoring data shall be retained for analysis

  Scenario: Availability Incident Response
    Given availability monitoring detects system issues
    When availability incidents occur
    Then incidents shall be classified by severity
    And incident response procedures shall be initiated
    And stakeholders shall be notified according to escalation procedures
    And incident resolution shall be tracked and reported
```

## Technical Requirements

### Monitoring Infrastructure

- **Uptime Monitoring**: Continuous system availability monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and throughput measurement
- **Alerting**: Real-time availability alerts and notifications
- **Reporting**: Availability metrics and SLA reporting

### Availability Metrics

- **System Uptime**: Percentage of time systems are operational
- **Response Time**: System response time measurements
- **Throughput**: Transaction processing capacity
- **Error Rates**: System error and failure rates

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Availability monitoring policy documented
- [ ] Monitoring tools deployed and configured
- [ ] Availability thresholds and alerts established
- [ ] Incident response procedures implemented
- [ ] Availability reporting automated
- [ ] Staff training on availability procedures completed
