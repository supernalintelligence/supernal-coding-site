# COMP-SOC-003: Privileged Access Management

## Overview

**Purpose**: Administrative access controls  
**TSC Reference**: CC6.2 - System Access Controls  
**Category**: security, privileged-access  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: SOC 2

## Description

Implements privileged access management controls for administrative accounts including approval processes, monitoring, and regular access reviews.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Privileged Access Management
  As a service organization
  I want to implement privileged access management controls
  So that I can meet SOC 2 security requirements for administrative access

  Background:
    Given the organization has systems requiring administrative access
    And SOC 2 compliance is required
    And privileged access management policies are established

  Scenario: Privileged Account Creation
    Given a user requires administrative access
    When privileged access request is submitted
    And business justification is provided
    And senior management approval is obtained
    Then privileged account shall be created with minimal necessary permissions
    And account creation shall be logged and monitored
    And account shall have expiration date if temporary

  Scenario: Privileged Access Monitoring
    Given privileged accounts exist in the system
    When administrative activities are performed
    Then all privileged actions shall be logged
    And logs shall include user identity, timestamp, and actions performed
    And suspicious activities shall trigger alerts
    And logs shall be reviewed regularly

  Scenario: Privileged Account Review
    Given privileged accounts exist
    When periodic access review is conducted
    And privileged account usage is assessed
    And business need is re-validated
    Then unnecessary privileged access shall be removed
    And access modifications shall be documented
    And review results shall be reported to management
```

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Standards

- **Account Management**: Separate privileged accounts from standard user accounts
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required for all privileged access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logging and alerting for privileged activities
- **Review**: Quarterly access reviews with management approval

### Security Controls

- **Password Policy**: Enhanced password requirements for privileged accounts
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout and re-authentication
- **Network Access**: Privileged access restricted to authorized networks/devices
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass procedures with enhanced logging and approval

## Compliance Mapping

### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria

- **CC6.2**: The entity implements logical access security measures to protect against threats from sources outside its system boundaries
- **CC6.3**: The entity authorizes, modifies, or removes access to data, software, functions, and other protected information assets

### Implementation Evidence

- Privileged access management policy documentation
- Privileged account inventory and access matrix
- Access request and approval workflows
- Privileged activity monitoring logs
- Quarterly access review reports
- Emergency access procedures and logs

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing

- **Access Control Tests**: Verify privileged access restrictions
- **Monitoring Tests**: Validate logging and alerting functionality
- **Authentication Tests**: Confirm MFA requirements for privileged accounts

### Manual Testing

- **Policy Compliance**: Review privileged access procedures
- **Access Review**: Validate quarterly review processes
- **Emergency Procedures**: Test break-glass access controls

### Penetration Testing

- **Privilege Escalation**: Test for unauthorized privilege escalation
- **Account Compromise**: Simulate privileged account compromise scenarios
- **Monitoring Evasion**: Test detection capabilities for privileged abuse

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation

```bash
# Example privileged access monitoring
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k privileged_access
sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa -k privileged_access
sudo auditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k privileged_access

# Privileged session logging
script -a /var/log/privileged_sessions/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_$(whoami).log
```

### Configuration Requirements

- **LDAP/AD Integration**: Centralized privileged account management
- **SIEM Integration**: Privileged activity log forwarding
- **PAM Solutions**: Privileged access management platform implementation
- **Vault Integration**: Secure credential storage and rotation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Privileged access management policy documented and approved
- [ ] Privileged accounts identified and inventoried
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication implemented for all privileged accounts
- [ ] Privileged activity monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Quarterly access review process established
- [ ] Emergency access procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Staff training completed on privileged access procedures
- [ ] Compliance evidence collected and documented

## Traceability

- **Policy Documents**: Privileged Access Management Policy
- **Procedures**: PAM-001 through PAM-005
- **Technical Controls**: Identity and Access Management System
- **Monitoring**: SIEM privileged access dashboards
- **Reviews**: Quarterly Access Review Reports
