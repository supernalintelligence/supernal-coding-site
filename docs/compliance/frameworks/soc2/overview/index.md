# SOC 2 Security Controls Compliance

SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) is an auditing standard that evaluates the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of service organizations. Supernal Coding provides comprehensive template requirements to ensure your systems meet SOC 2 Type II compliance standards.

## SOC 2 Types

### SOC 2 Type I

- **Point-in-Time Assessment** - Evaluates design of controls at a specific date
- **Control Design** - Assesses whether controls are suitably designed
- **Implementation** - Verifies controls are implemented as designed
- **Duration** - Snapshot assessment, typically 1-2 months to complete

### SOC 2 Type II

- **Period Assessment** - Evaluates operating effectiveness over 3-12 months
- **Control Effectiveness** - Tests whether controls operated effectively throughout the period
- **Evidence Collection** - Requires extensive evidence of control operation
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Ongoing assessment of control effectiveness

## Quick Start

Get started with SOC 2 compliance quickly:

### 1. Initialize SOC 2 Project

```bash
# Create new SOC 2 compliance project
sc init --framework=soc2 --name="Security Controls System"

# Generate initial requirements
sc req generate --framework=soc2 --category=security-controls
```

### 2. Set Up Security Controls

```bash
# Create core SOC 2 requirements
sc req new "Access Control Implementation" --framework=soc2 --priority=high
sc req new "System Monitoring Setup" --framework=soc2 --priority=high
sc req new "Change Management Process" --framework=soc2 --priority=medium
```

### 3. Validate Controls

```bash
# Check compliance status
sc compliance check --framework=soc2

# Generate SOC 2 report
sc compliance report --framework=soc2 --type=type2 --format=pdf
```

### 4. Monitor Security

```bash
# View requirement status
sc req list --framework=soc2 --status=pending

# Track compliance score
sc compliance score --framework=soc2
```

## Getting Started

### Initialize SOC 2 Project

```bash
# Initialize project with SOC 2 templates
sc init --framework=soc2

# Select trust service criteria
sc soc2 configure --criteria=security,availability,processing-integrity

# Validate all SOC 2 requirements
sc req validate --framework=soc2

# Generate SOC 2 readiness assessment
sc compliance assessment --framework=soc2 --type=readiness
```

### Template Requirements

All SOC 2 template requirements follow the standard See requirement template in supernal-code-package format and include:

- **Trust Service Criteria Mapping** - Direct reference to applicable TSC
- **Control Objectives** - Specific control objectives and activities
- **Gherkin Specifications** - BDD-style acceptance criteria
- **Technical Context** - Implementation guidance for security controls
- **Testing Strategy** - Control testing and validation approach
- **Evidence Requirements** - Documentation and audit trail requirements

## Control Environment

### Organizational Controls

- **Governance Structure** - Board oversight and management responsibility
- **Risk Assessment** - Regular risk assessment and management processes
- **Control Activities** - Policies and procedures to address risks
- **Information and Communication** - Relevant information communication systems
