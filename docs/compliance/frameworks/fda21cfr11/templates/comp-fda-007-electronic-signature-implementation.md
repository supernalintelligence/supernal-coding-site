# COMP-FDA-007: Electronic Signature Implementation

## Overview

**Purpose**: Electronic signature system implementation  
**CFR Section**: 21 CFR 11.50, 11.70  
**Category**: electronic-signatures, implementation  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11

## Description

Implements electronic signature systems that are legally binding equivalent of handwritten signatures with appropriate security and authentication controls.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Electronic Signature System Validation
  As a validation engineer
  I want to validate electronic signature implementation
  So that I can verify FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance

  Background:
    Given an electronic signature system is implemented
    And FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance is required
    And electronic signature validation is being conducted

  Scenario: Electronic Signature Authentication Validation
    Given electronic signature authentication is implemented
    When signature creation is tested
    And authentication mechanisms are verified
    And signature uniqueness is validated
    Then each electronic signature shall be unique to one individual
    And signature creation shall require authentication
    And signature shall be linked to the signed record

  Scenario: Electronic Signature Security Validation
    Given electronic signature security controls exist
    When signature integrity is tested
    And tampering detection is verified
    And signature verification is validated
    Then electronic signatures shall be tamper-evident
    And signature verification shall be reliable
    And signature security shall prevent falsification

  Scenario: Electronic Signature Legal Equivalence Validation
    Given electronic signatures are used for regulatory records
    When legal equivalence is assessed
    And signature binding is verified
    And signature meaning is validated
    Then electronic signatures shall be legally binding
    And signature meaning shall be equivalent to handwritten signatures
    And signature intent shall be clearly established
```

## Technical Context

### Implementation Requirements

- **Signature Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for signature creation
- **Signature Uniqueness**: Each signature unique to one individual
- **Signature Binding**: Permanent association between signature and record
- **Signature Integrity**: Tamper-evident signature protection
- **Signature Verification**: Reliable signature verification mechanisms
- **Legal Equivalence**: Legally binding equivalent to handwritten signatures

### System Architecture

```typescript
interface ElectronicSignatureSystem {
  authenticationService: AuthenticationService;
  signatureEngine: SignatureEngine;
  integrityProtection: IntegrityProtection;
  verificationService: VerificationService;
  auditTrail: SignatureAuditTrail;
}

interface ElectronicSignature {
  signatureId: string;
  signerId: string;
  signerName: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  recordId: string;
  signatureData: SignatureData;
  authenticationMethod: AuthenticationMethod;
  integrityHash: string;
}

interface SignatureData {
  biometricData?: BiometricData;
  cryptographicSignature: string;
  signingReason: string;
  signingLocation: string;
  certificateInfo: CertificateInfo;
}
```

### Validation Strategy

1. **Authentication Testing**: Verify multi-factor authentication requirements
2. **Uniqueness Validation**: Confirm signature uniqueness per individual
3. **Binding Verification**: Test permanent record-signature association
4. **Integrity Testing**: Validate tamper-evident protection mechanisms
5. **Legal Compliance**: Verify legal equivalence to handwritten signatures

## Testing Strategy

### Functional Testing

- Signature creation and authentication workflows
- Signature verification and validation processes
- Multi-user signature scenarios
- Signature integrity under various conditions

### Security Testing

- Signature tampering attempts and detection
- Authentication bypass testing
- Cryptographic signature validation
- Access control for signature functions

### Compliance Testing

- Legal equivalence verification
- Regulatory requirement mapping
- Audit trail completeness
- Long-term signature validity

## Compliance Evidence

### Required Documentation

- Electronic Signature System Design Specification
- Authentication and authorization procedures
- Signature creation and verification procedures
- Cryptographic implementation documentation
- Legal equivalence assessment and validation
- User training records for electronic signatures

### Audit Trail

- Electronic signature creation records
- Authentication and verification logs
- Signature integrity validation records
- System configuration and change records
- User access and training records

_Note: Individual requirement template files are generated when using `sc init --framework=fda21cfr11`_

## Usage Examples

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate this requirement
sc req new --template=REQ-FDA-007 --title="Electronic Signature Implementation"

# Validate e-signature implementation
sc req validate REQ-FDA-007 --framework=fda21cfr11

# Generate signature validation protocols
sc validation generate-esig --requirement=REQ-FDA-007
```

### Implementation Example

```javascript
// Electronic signature validation
const esigValidator = new ElectronicSignatureValidator();
const signatureSystem = await loadSignatureSystem();

const validationResult = await esigValidator.validateSignatureSystem(
  signatureSystem,
  {
    requirement: 'REQ-FDA-007',
    testAuthentication: true,
    testIntegrity: true,
    testLegalEquivalence: true,
  }
);

if (validationResult.isCompliant) {
  console.log('Electronic signature system compliant with REQ-FDA-007');
} else {
  console.log('E-signature issues found:', validationResult.issues);
}
```
