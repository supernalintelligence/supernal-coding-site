# COMP-FDA-001: Computer System Validation

## Overview

**Purpose**: Computer system validation procedures and lifecycle  
**CFR Section**: 21 CFR 11.10(a)  
**Category**: csv, validation  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11

## Description

Establishes comprehensive computer system validation procedures ensuring systems are suitable for their intended use and maintain data integrity throughout the system lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Computer System Validation Implementation
  As a regulated organization
  I want to validate computer systems
  So that I can ensure FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance

  Background:
    Given the organization uses electronic record systems
    And FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance is required
    And validation procedures are established

  Scenario: Validation Master Plan Creation
    Given a computer system requires validation
    When the Validation Master Plan (VMP) is created
    And validation approach is defined
    And roles and responsibilities are assigned
    Then the VMP shall define validation strategy
    And validation activities shall be planned
    And acceptance criteria shall be established

  Scenario: System Requirements Specification
    Given validation planning is complete
    When User Requirements Specification (URS) is created
    And Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) is developed
    And system architecture is defined
    Then requirements shall be traceable
    And system design shall meet user needs
    And regulatory requirements shall be addressed

  Scenario: Installation Qualification (IQ)
    Given system requirements are approved
    When system installation is performed
    And IQ protocols are executed
    And installation documentation is reviewed
    Then system shall be installed per specifications
    And all components shall be verified
    And installation shall be documented

  Scenario: Operational Qualification (OQ)
    Given IQ is successfully completed
    When OQ protocols are executed
    And system functions are tested
    And operating procedures are verified
    Then system shall operate per specifications
    And all functions shall be validated
    And deviations shall be resolved

  Scenario: Performance Qualification (PQ)
    Given OQ is successfully completed
    When PQ protocols are executed
    And system performance is validated
    And user acceptance testing is performed
    Then system shall meet performance criteria
    And business processes shall be validated
    And system shall be ready for production use
```

## Technical Context

### Implementation Requirements

- **Validation Master Plan (VMP)**: Overall validation strategy and approach
- **User Requirements Specification (URS)**: Business and functional requirements
- **Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)**: Detailed system requirements
- **Design Qualification (DQ)**: System design verification
- **Installation Qualification (IQ)**: Installation verification procedures
- **Operational Qualification (OQ)**: Functional testing procedures
- **Performance Qualification (PQ)**: Performance and user acceptance testing

### System Architecture

```typescript
interface ComputerSystemValidation {
  validationMasterPlan: ValidationMasterPlan;
  userRequirements: UserRequirementsSpecification;
  functionalRequirements: FunctionalRequirementsSpecification;
  designQualification: DesignQualification;
  installationQualification: InstallationQualification;
  operationalQualification: OperationalQualification;
  performanceQualification: PerformanceQualification;
}

interface ValidationMasterPlan {
  scope: string;
  approach: ValidationApproach;
  riskAssessment: RiskAssessment;
  validationTeam: ValidationTeam;
  timeline: ValidationTimeline;
  acceptanceCriteria: AcceptanceCriteria[];
}

interface QualificationProtocol {
  protocolId: string;
  objective: string;
  scope: string;
  testCases: TestCase[];
  acceptanceCriteria: AcceptanceCriteria[];
  executionRecords: ExecutionRecord[];
}
```

### Validation Strategy

1. **Risk-Based Approach**: Focus validation efforts based on system risk assessment
2. **Lifecycle Validation**: Validate throughout system development lifecycle
3. **Documented Evidence**: Maintain comprehensive validation documentation
4. **Traceability Matrix**: Ensure requirements traceability throughout validation
5. **Change Control**: Manage system changes through validated change control process

## Testing Strategy

### Validation Testing Phases

#### Design Qualification (DQ)

- Requirements traceability verification
- System architecture review
- Design document approval
- Risk assessment validation

#### Installation Qualification (IQ)

- Hardware installation verification
- Software installation verification
- System configuration validation
- Environmental condition verification

#### Operational Qualification (OQ)

- Functional testing of all system features
- User interface testing
- Security feature validation
- Error handling verification

#### Performance Qualification (PQ)

- End-to-end business process testing
- Performance benchmarking
- User acceptance testing
- Production readiness assessment

## Implementation Notes

### Prerequisites

- Validation team training and competence
- Validation procedures and templates
- System development lifecycle procedures
- Risk management procedures

### Dependencies

- Software Development Lifecycle (REQ-FDA-002)
- System Requirements Specification (REQ-FDA-003)
- Electronic Signature Implementation (REQ-FDA-007)
- Audit Trail Requirements (REQ-FDA-010)

### Constraints

- Must comply with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements
- Must follow GAMP 5 guidelines for computerized systems
- Must maintain validation throughout system lifecycle
- Must support regulatory inspections and audits

## Compliance Evidence

### Required Documentation

- Validation Master Plan with strategy and approach
- User Requirements Specification with business needs
- Functional Requirements Specification with system requirements
- IQ/OQ/PQ protocols with test cases and results
- Validation summary report with compliance assessment
- Traceability matrix linking requirements to test results

### Audit Trail

- Validation planning and approval records
- Protocol execution records and deviations
- Test result documentation and approvals
- Change control records for validation documents
- Training records for validation team members

## Related Requirements

- REQ-FDA-002: Software Development Lifecycle
- REQ-FDA-003: System Requirements Specification
- REQ-FDA-004: Installation Qualification
- REQ-FDA-005: Operational Qualification
- REQ-FDA-006: Performance Qualification

_Note: Individual requirement template files are generated when using `sc init --framework=fda21cfr11`_

## Usage Examples

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Generate this requirement
sc req new --template=REQ-FDA-001 --title="Computer System Validation"

# Validate CSV implementation
sc req validate REQ-FDA-001 --framework=fda21cfr11

# Generate IQ/OQ/PQ protocols
sc validation generate-protocols --requirement=REQ-FDA-001 --phases=iq,oq,pq
```

### Integration Example

```javascript
// CSV validation workflow
const csvValidator = new FDA21CFRValidator();
const validationPlan = await loadValidationMasterPlan();

const validationResult = await csvValidator.executeValidation(validationPlan, {
  requirement: 'REQ-FDA-001',
  phases: ['iq', 'oq', 'pq'],
  riskLevel: 'high',
  includeTraceability: true,
});

if (validationResult.isCompliant) {
  console.log('System validation completed successfully');
  await generateValidationSummaryReport(validationResult);
} else {
  console.log('Validation issues found:', validationResult.issues);
  await generateDeviationReport(validationResult.deviations);
}
```
