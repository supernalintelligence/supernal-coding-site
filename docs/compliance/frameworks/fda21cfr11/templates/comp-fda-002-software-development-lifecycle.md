# COMP-FDA-002: Software Development Lifecycle

## Overview

**Purpose**: Software development and maintenance procedures  
**CFR Section**: 21 CFR 11.10(a)  
**Category**: csv, development  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11

## Description

Implements structured software development lifecycle procedures with appropriate controls, testing, and documentation for FDA-regulated systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Software Development Lifecycle
  As a regulated organization
  I want to implement structured SDLC procedures
  So that I can ensure software quality and FDA compliance

  Background:
    Given the organization develops FDA-regulated software systems
    And 21 CFR Part 11 compliance is required
    And SDLC procedures are established

  Scenario: Requirements Management
    Given software requirements are defined
    When requirements management is performed
    Then requirements shall be documented and traceable
    And requirements changes shall be controlled
    And requirements shall be reviewed and approved
    And requirements traceability shall be maintained

  Scenario: Design and Development
    Given software design is performed
    When development activities are conducted
    Then design specifications shall be documented
    And coding standards shall be followed
    And peer reviews shall be conducted
    And design changes shall be controlled

  Scenario: Testing and Validation
    Given software testing is performed
    When validation activities are conducted
    Then test plans shall be documented and approved
    And test execution shall be documented
    And defects shall be tracked and resolved
    And test results shall be reviewed and approved
```
