# COMP-FDA-009: Non-Repudiation Controls

## Overview

**Purpose**: Non-repudiation controls for electronic signatures  
**CFR Section**: 21 CFR 11.50, 11.70  
**Category**: esig, non-repudiation  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11

## Description

Implements non-repudiation controls to ensure that electronic signatures cannot be denied by the signer and maintain integrity over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Non-Repudiation Controls
  As a regulated organization
  I want to implement non-repudiation controls
  So that electronic signatures cannot be denied

  Background:
    Given electronic signatures are used
    And non-repudiation is required
    And signature integrity must be maintained

  Scenario: Signature Binding
    Given an electronic signature is created
    When signature binding is performed
    Then signature shall be cryptographically bound to record
    And signature shall be tamper-evident
    And signature integrity shall be verifiable
    And signature shall be non-repudiable

  Scenario: Signature Verification
    Given a signed record exists
    When signature verification is performed
    Then signature authenticity shall be verified
    And signer identity shall be confirmed
    And signature timestamp shall be validated
    And record integrity shall be verified
```

## Technical Requirements

### Non-Repudiation Components

- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic signature binding
- **Certificate Management**: PKI certificate validation
- **Timestamp Services**: Trusted timestamp authority
- **Audit Trails**: Signature event logging

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Non-repudiation controls implemented
- [ ] Signature binding mechanisms deployed
- [ ] Verification procedures established
- [ ] Documentation completed

---

_This requirement supports FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for non-repudiation controls._
