# COMP-FDA-006: Performance Qualification

## Overview

**Purpose**: Performance qualification procedures and documentation  
**CFR Section**: 21 CFR 11.10(a)  
**Category**: csv, qualification  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11

## Description

Establishes performance qualification (PQ) procedures to verify that systems consistently perform according to specifications under normal operating conditions and meet all user requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Performance Qualification
  As a validation team
  I want to perform performance qualification
  So that I can verify system performance meets requirements

  Background:
    Given operational qualification is complete
    And performance qualification is required
    And PQ procedures are established

  Scenario: End-to-End Process Testing
    Given business processes are defined
    When PQ testing is performed
    Then complete business workflows shall be tested
    And process performance shall meet specifications
    And user requirements shall be satisfied
    And system integration shall be verified

  Scenario: Worst-Case Scenario Testing
    Given worst-case conditions are identified
    When stress testing is performed
    Then system shall perform under maximum load
    And data integrity shall be maintained
    And performance thresholds shall be met
    And recovery procedures shall be validated

  Scenario: User Acceptance Testing
    Given end users are trained
    When user acceptance testing is conducted
    Then users shall successfully complete workflows
    And system usability shall be acceptable
    And training effectiveness shall be demonstrated
    And user feedback shall be documented
```

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Testing

- **Load Testing**: System performance under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: System behavior under extreme conditions
- **Endurance Testing**: Long-term system stability
- **User Acceptance**: End-user workflow validation

### Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: System response time requirements
- **Throughput**: Transaction processing capacity
- **Availability**: System uptime requirements
- **Accuracy**: Data processing accuracy validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] PQ protocol developed and approved
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] PQ documentation completed
- [ ] PQ review and approval obtained
- [ ] System ready for production use
