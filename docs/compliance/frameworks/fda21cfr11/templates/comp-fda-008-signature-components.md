# COMP-FDA-008: Signature Components

## Overview

**Purpose**: Electronic signature component requirements  
**CFR Section**: 21 CFR 11.50, 11.70  
**Category**: esig, components  
**Priority**: High  
**Framework**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11

## Description

Establishes requirements for electronic signature components including biometric, non-biometric, and combination signature methods.

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Electronic Signature Components
  As a regulated organization
  I want to implement signature components
  So that I can meet FDA electronic signature requirements

  Background:
    Given electronic signatures are required
    And signature components must be validated
    And 21 CFR Part 11 compliance is required

  Scenario: Biometric Signature Components
    Given biometric signatures are implemented
    When signature verification is performed
    Then biometric data shall be unique to the individual
    And biometric verification shall be reliable
    And biometric data shall be protected from compromise
    And signature shall be linked to the signed record

  Scenario: Non-Biometric Signature Components
    Given non-biometric signatures are implemented
    When signature creation is performed
    Then signature shall use unique identification
    And signature shall use secure authentication
    And signature components shall be under sole control
    And signature shall be verifiable and non-repudiable
```

## Technical Requirements

### Signature Components

- **Identification Component**: Unique user identification
- **Authentication Component**: Secure authentication method
- **Biometric Component**: Biometric verification (if applicable)
- **Cryptographic Component**: Digital signature technology

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Signature components defined and implemented
- [ ] Component validation completed
- [ ] Security controls implemented
- [ ] Documentation completed

---

_This requirement supports FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for electronic signature components._
