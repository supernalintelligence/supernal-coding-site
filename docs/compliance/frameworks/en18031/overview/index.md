# EN 18031:2024 AI System Trustworthiness

## Overview

EN 18031 is an emerging European standard for AI system trustworthiness, security, and ethical development. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing risks associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems.

## Standard Information

- **Standard**: EN 18031:2024 (Draft/Emerging)
- **Focus**: AI System Trustworthiness
- **Scope**: Development, deployment, and operation of AI/ML systems
- **Total Controls**: 40 key controls across 5 categories
- **Alignment**: EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF

## Key Focus Areas

EN 18031 addresses unique challenges of AI systems that traditional security standards don't fully cover:

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Model poisoning, evasion, extraction
- **Data Integrity**: Training data quality, bias, provenance
- **Model Security**: Backdoors, drift, supply chain risks
- **AI Safety**: Fail-safe mechanisms, robustness, human oversight
- **Transparency**: Explainability, audit trails, accountability

## Control Categories

### AI Governance (8 controls)

Establishing organizational framework for responsible AI:

- AI governance framework and risk management
- AI ethics board and stakeholder engagement
- Incident response and documentation standards
- Transparency and audit trail requirements

### Data Management for AI (7 controls)

Ensuring quality and integrity of AI training data:

- Training data quality and bias detection
- Data provenance and versioning
- Privacy protection in AI systems
- Data poisoning prevention

### Model Development & Security (10 controls)

Securing the ML development lifecycle:

- Secure model development and validation
- Model versioning and adversarial testing
- Explainability and fairness testing
- Security scanning and drift detection
- Backdoor prevention and supply chain security

### AI System Operations (8 controls)

Operational security for deployed AI:

- Continuous monitoring and inference security
- Model serving infrastructure protection
- Prompt injection prevention
- Output validation and rate limiting
- Rollback procedures

### Safety & Reliability (7 controls)

Ensuring AI system safety:

- Safety requirements and fail-safe mechanisms
- Human oversight and continuous learning safety
- Comprehensive testing and robustness
- Emergency stop procedures

## Why EN 18031 Matters

### Unique AI Risks

Traditional security standards (ISO 27001, SOC2) don't address:

- **Model-Specific Attacks**: Adversarial examples, model inversion
- **Data Poisoning**: Corrupting training data to influence model behavior
- **Model Drift**: Performance degradation over time
- **Bias & Fairness**: Discriminatory outcomes from biased training data
- **Explainability**: Understanding AI decision-making
- **AI Supply Chain**: Third-party models, pre-trained models, datasets

### Regulatory Alignment

**EU AI Act**: EN 18031 helps comply with:

- High-risk AI system requirements
- Transparency obligations
- Human oversight requirements
- Documentation and record-keeping

**ISO/IEC 42001**: AI Management System standard alignment
**NIST AI RMF**: Maps to NIST AI Risk Management Framework

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Assessment

1. **AI System Inventory**: Catalog all AI/ML systems
2. **Risk Classification**: Identify high-risk AI applications
3. **Gap Analysis**: Compare against EN 18031 requirements
4. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-risk systems first

### Phase 2: Governance

1. **AI Governance Framework**: Establish policies and procedures
2. **AI Ethics Board**: Create review committee
3. **Documentation Standards**: Define model cards, datasheets
4. **Training Programs**: AI security awareness

### Phase 3: Technical Controls

1. **MLOps Integration**: Embed security in ML pipelines
2. **Data Controls**: Implement data quality, provenance tracking
3. **Model Security**: Add adversarial testing, scanning
4. **Monitoring**: Deploy drift detection, bias monitoring

### Phase 4: Validation

1. **Security Testing**: Adversarial robustness evaluation
2. **Fairness Testing**: Bias and fairness metrics
3. **Explainability**: Implement XAI techniques
4. **Audit Preparation**: Collect evidence
