# COMP-HIPAA-002: Risk Analysis

## Overview

**Purpose**: Conduct accurate and thorough assessment of risks to ePHI  
**HIPAA Reference**: §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)  
**Category**: administrative  
**Priority**: high  
**Framework**: HIPAA Security Rule

## Description

Implements HIPAA Security Rule requirement §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) to conduct accurate and thorough assessment of risks to ephi. This control ensures compliance with federal healthcare information security regulations for protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Risk Analysis
  As a HIPAA compliance officer
  I want to implement risk analysis
  So that I can meet HIPAA Security Rule §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) requirements

  Background:
    Given the organization handles ePHI
    And HIPAA Security Rule compliance is required
    And security safeguards are being implemented

  Scenario: HIPAA Control Implementation
    Given HIPAA requirements are identified
    When control measures are implemented
    And procedures are documented
    And workforce is trained
    Then ePHI shall be protected appropriately
    And control shall meet HIPAA requirements
    And evidence shall be documented

  Scenario: HIPAA Control Verification
    Given HIPAA control is implemented
    When control effectiveness is tested
    And compliance is verified
    And gaps are identified
    Then control shall demonstrate effectiveness
    And gaps shall be remediated
    And verification shall be documented
```

## Technical Context

### Implementation Requirements

- Implement appropriate administrative, physical, or technical safeguards
- Document policies and procedures
- Train workforce on HIPAA security requirements
- Monitor control effectiveness
- Review and update regularly per §164.316

### ePHI Protection

This control protects electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) which includes all individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained electronically.

## Validation Strategy

### Testing Approach

1. **Policy Documentation Review**: Verify HIPAA procedures are documented
2. **Technical Control Testing**: Confirm technical safeguards are in place
3. **Workforce Verification**: Check HIPAA training and awareness
4. **Effectiveness Assessment**: Test control operation
5. **Compliance Audit**: Verify against HIPAA Security Rule requirements

### Required/Addressable Determination

**Implementation Status**: [To be determined - Required or Addressable per §164.306(d)]

Note: HIPAA distinguishes between "Required" and "Addressable" specifications. Covered entities must implement Required specifications. For Addressable specifications, entities must assess whether reasonable and appropriate, and if not, implement equivalent alternative measures.

## Evidence Requirements

### Required Documentation

- HIPAA security policies and procedures
- Technical safeguard configurations
- Workforce training records
- Risk assessments and risk management plans
- Security incident logs and responses
- Audit logs and access records
- Business associate agreements (if applicable)

### Evidence Collection

- Maintain HIPAA documentation for 6 years per §164.316(b)(2)(i)
- Store procedures in written (electronic or paper) form
- Document all changes with effective dates
- Make available to responsible personnel

## Related Controls

### Within HIPAA Security Rule

- Related HIPAA Security Rule requirements will be identified during implementation

### Cross-Framework

- comp-iso27001-XXX: ISO 27001 information security controls
- comp-iso13485-XXX: ISO 13485 medical device quality (if applicable)
- comp-fda-XXX: FDA 21 CFR Part 11 (if applicable for electronic records)

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices

- Conduct thorough risk analysis per §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A)
- Implement defense-in-depth approach
- Document implementation specifications as Required or Addressable
- Maintain detailed audit trails
- Test contingency plans regularly
- Review business associate agreements annually

### Common Pitfalls

- Treating Addressable as Optional (it's not - must implement or document equivalent alternative)
- Insufficient risk analysis
- Missing business associate agreements
- Inadequate workforce training
- Poor documentation retention
- Failure to review and update policies

### Covered Entities vs Business Associates

**Covered Entities**: Healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses  
**Business Associates**: Service providers accessing ePHI on behalf of covered entities

Both must comply with HIPAA Security Rule, though some requirements differ.
