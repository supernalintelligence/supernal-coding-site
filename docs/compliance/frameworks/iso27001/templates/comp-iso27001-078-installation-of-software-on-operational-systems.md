Feature: Installation of Software on Operational Systems
  As an information security officer
  I want to implement installation of software on operational systems
  So that I can meet ISO 27001 A.8.19 requirements

  Background:
    Given the organization has an ISMS
    And ISO 27001 certification is required
    And control implementation is planned

  Scenario: Control Implementation
    Given security requirements are identified
    When control measures are implemented
    And procedures are documented
    And personnel are trained
    Then control shall be effectively implemented
    And control shall meet ISO 27001 requirements
    And evidence shall be documented

  Scenario: Control Verification
    Given control is implemented
    When control effectiveness is tested
    And compliance is verified
    And gaps are identified
    Then control shall demonstrate effectiveness
    And gaps shall be remediated
    And verification shall be documented
```
