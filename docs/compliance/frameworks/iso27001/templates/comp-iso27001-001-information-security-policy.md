  So that I can meet ISO 27001 A.5.1 requirements

  Background:
    Given the organization has an ISMS
    And ISO 27001 certification is required
    And management commitment is documented

  Scenario: Security Policy Creation
    Given information security requirements are identified
    When policy framework is developed
    And management approval is obtained
    And policy document is published
    Then policy shall define security objectives
    And policy shall be aligned with business objectives
    And policy shall reference relevant laws and regulations

  Scenario: Policy Communication
    Given security policy is approved
    When policy is distributed to organization
    And training materials are prepared
    And acknowledgment process is implemented
    Then all employees shall receive policy
    And policy shall be accessible to all
    And policy understanding shall be verified

  Scenario: Policy Review and Update
    Given security policy is in effect
    When annual review is conducted
    And changes in business are assessed
    And regulatory changes are evaluated
    Then policy shall be updated as needed
    And changes shall be communicated
    And new approval shall be obtained

  Scenario: Policy Compliance Monitoring
    Given security policy requirements are defined
    When compliance monitoring is performed
    And violations are identified
    And corrective actions are implemented
    Then compliance metrics shall be tracked
    And violations shall be documented
    And remediation shall be verified
```

## Technical Context

### Policy Components

```typescript
interface InformationSecurityPolicy {
  policyDocument: {
    version: string;
    approvalDate: Date;
    effectiveDate: Date;
    reviewDate: Date;
    approvedBy: string[];
    scope: string;
  };

  objectives: SecurityObjective[];
  principles: SecurityPrinciple[];
  responsibilities: SecurityResponsibility[];
  compliance: ComplianceRequirement[];
  enforcement: EnforcementMechanism;

  relatedPolicies: {
    acceptableUse: Policy;
    accessControl: Policy;
    dataClassification: Policy;
    incidentResponse: Policy;
    businessContinuity: Policy;
  };
}

interface SecurityObjective {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  measurableTarget: string;
  responsibility: string;
  reviewFrequency: 'quarterly' | 'annually';
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

- **Policy Document**: Formal document approved by senior management
- **Distribution Mechanism**: Accessible to all employees and relevant external parties
- **Acknowledgment System**: Tracking of policy receipt and understanding
- **Review Process**: Regular review and update cycle
- **Communication Channel**: Clear mechanism for policy dissemination
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ongoing verification of policy adherence

## Validation Strategy

### Policy Adequacy Assessment

1. **Content Verification**
   - Verify all required elements are present
   - Confirm alignment with ISO 27001 requirements
   - Check regulatory compliance references

2. **Distribution Verification**
   - Confirm all employees received policy
   - Verify acknowledgment records
   - Check accessibility of policy documents

3. **Effectiveness Assessment**
   - Survey employee understanding
   - Review incident reports for policy violations
   - Assess corrective action effectiveness

### Testing Approach

```typescript
describe('Information Security Policy - ISO 27001 A.5.1', () => {
  test('Policy document exists and is approved', () => {
    const policy = getPolicyDocument('information-security');
    expect(policy).toBeDefined();
    expect(policy.approvedBy).toInclude('CEO');
    expect(policy.effectiveDate).toBeLessThan(Date.now());
  });

  test('Policy is accessible to all employees', () => {
    const employees = getEmployeeList();
    employees.forEach((employee) => {
      const hasAccess = canAccessPolicy(employee, 'information-security');
      expect(hasAccess).toBe(true);
    });
  });

  test('Policy acknowledgment is tracked', () => {
    const employees = getActiveEmployees();
    const acknowledgments = getPolicyAcknowledgments('information-security');
    expect(acknowledgments.length).toBeGreaterThan(employees.length * 0.95);
  });
});
```

## Evidence Requirements

### Required Documentation

- **Policy Document**: Approved information security policy
- **Approval Records**: Management sign-off and approval trail
- **Distribution Records**: Evidence of policy communication
- **Acknowledgment Records**: Employee acknowledgment confirmations
- **Review Records**: Annual review meeting minutes and updates
- **Training Materials**: Policy awareness training content
- **Compliance Reports**: Policy compliance monitoring results

### Evidence Collection

- Maintain policy documents in version control
- Store approval signatures securely
- Track distribution via email/intranet analytics
- Collect digital acknowledgments
- Document review meetings and decisions
- Archive training completion records

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices

- Keep policy concise and readable (avoid overly technical language)
- Separate high-level policy from detailed procedures
- Review policy annually or when significant changes occur
- Ensure policy is signed by CEO or equivalent authority
- Make policy easily accessible via intranet
- Provide policy in multiple languages if needed

### Common Pitfalls

- Policy too technical or too vague
- Lack of management commitment
- Poor communication and awareness
- Infrequent reviews leading to outdated policy
- No mechanism to enforce policy
- Policy not aligned with actual practices

### Implementation Timeline

- Week 1: Draft policy framework
- Week 2: Management review and approval
- Week 3: Communication and training
- Week 4: Acknowledgment collection
- Ongoing: Annual reviews and updates
