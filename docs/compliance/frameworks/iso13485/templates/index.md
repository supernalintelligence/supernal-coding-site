## Usage Instructions

### Generating Templates

```bash
# Initialize project with ISO 13485 templates
sc init --framework=iso13485

# Copy specific template to project
sc req template --id=REQ-ISO-001 --copy-to=./requirements/

# Validate ISO 13485 compliance
sc req validate --framework=iso13485

# Generate compliance report
sc compliance report --framework=iso13485 --output=./reports/
```

### Customizing Templates

Each template can be customized for your specific project while maintaining ISO 13485 compliance:

1. **Copy Template**: Use `sc req new --template=REQ-ISO-XXX` to create customized version
2. **Modify Content**: Update title, description, and acceptance criteria for your use case
3. **Maintain Traceability**: Keep ISO clause references and compliance mappings
4. **Validate Changes**: Run `sc req validate` to ensure continued compliance

### Template Structure

Each ISO 13485 template includes:

- **ISO Clause Mapping**: Direct reference to applicable ISO 13485 clauses
- **Gherkin Specifications**: BDD-style acceptance criteria for validation
- **Technical Context**: Implementation guidance and constraints
- **Testing Strategy**: Verification and validation approach
- **Compliance Evidence**: Required documentation and records
