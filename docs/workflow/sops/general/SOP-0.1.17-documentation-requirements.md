# Documentation Requirements & Templates

This document provides a central reference for all documentation requirements across Supernal Coding phases, including which documents are **REQUIRED** vs. **SUGGESTED** and links to available templates.

## Documentation Philosophy

**All documentation in Supernal Coding falls into one of four categories:**

1. **Templated** - Has a template with frontmatter validation (ADRs, security docs, requirements)
2. **Auto-Generated** - Created by tools (test reports, changelogs, API docs)
3. **Simple** - Straightforward docs that don't need templates (vision, problem statements)
4. **Optional** - Nice-to-have but not required (feature-specific planning docs)

**Every document is clearly marked as REQUIRED or SUGGESTED** in the phase sections below.

## Template Reference

All templates are located in `templates/docs/`:

### Architecture Templates

- **See ADR template in supernal-code-package** - Architecture Decision Records
- **See system template in supernal-code-package** - Solution Architecture Documents (SAD)
- **See template in supernal-code-package** - Component Design Documents (ADD)
- **See template in supernal-code-package** - Reusable architecture patterns

### Security & Compliance Templates

- **See template in supernal-code-package** - STRIDE analysis, attack trees
- **See template in supernal-code-package** - Quarterly risk evaluation
- **See template in supernal-code-package** - Requirement traceability

### Requirement Templates

- **See template in supernal-code-package** - Created via `sc requirement new` command

### SOP Templates

- **See template in supernal-code-package** - Standard Operating Procedures

- `docs/features/\{domain\}/\{feature\}/estimation.md` (phase: drafting)

### Phase 5: Requirements

**REQUIRED**:

- Requirements: `docs/requirements/[category]/req-[area]-[num]-[name].md`
  - Use `sc requirement new` to create with proper structure
  - Template enforced by CLI (See template in supernal-code-package)

**Feature-Specific (SUGGESTED)**:

- `docs/features/\{domain\}/\{feature\}/requirements.md` (phase: drafting)
- `docs/features/\{domain\}/\{feature\}/api-reference.md` (phase: drafting)

### Phase 6: Tests

- Test Strategy: `docs/planning/testing/test-strategy.md`
- Test Coverage Report: `docs/planning/testing/coverage-report.md` (auto-generated)
- E2E Scenarios: `docs/planning/testing/e2e-scenarios.md`

**Feature-Specific (SUGGESTED)**:

- `docs/features/\{domain\}/\{feature\}/test-plan.md` (phase: implementing)
- `docs/features/\{domain\}/\{feature\}/test-results.md` (phase: implementing/testing)

### Phase 7: Build

**REQUIRED** (When applicable):

- Architecture Decisions: `docs/architecture/decisions/` (See ADR template in supernal-code-package)

### Phase 12: Operations

**SUGGESTED**:

- Operations Runbooks: `docs/operations/runbooks/`
- Post-Launch Metrics: Auto-generated from monitoring

## Small Changes

For minor updates (< 1 day):

- Document in commit messages (`REQ-XXX: Description`)
- Inline code comments
- No separate documentation files needed

## Auto-Generated Documentation

These are created by tools, not manually:

- Test coverage reports (Jest/Vitest)
- API documentation (TypeDoc)
- Changelog (changesets)
- TypeScript types (generated)

## Validation

All documentation with templates is validated via:

```bash
sc validate --docs
```

Templates use frontmatter for:

- Naming pattern enforcement
- Required field validation
- Cross-reference checking
- Consistency validation

## Getting Help

```bash
# List available templates
ls -la templates/docs/**/*.template.md

# View template
cat templates/docs/architecture/decision.template.md

# Create from template (where applicable)
sc requirement new "Feature Name"  # Uses requirement template
# For others, copy template and fill in
```
