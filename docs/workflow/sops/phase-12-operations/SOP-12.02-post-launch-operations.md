## Phase 1: Production Access Control

### 1.1 Least Privilege Access

**Principle**: Grant minimum necessary access for role

**Access Tiers**:

1. **Read-Only** (Monitoring, support)
2. **Deployment** (Automated CI/CD only)
3. **Configuration** (DevOps, on-call engineers)
4. **Administrative** (Platform team leads, emergency only)

**Access Matrix**:

| Role      | Logs | Metrics | Deploy | Config | Database  | Secrets   |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | --------- |
| Support   | ✅   | ✅      | ❌     | ❌     | ❌        | ❌        |
| Developer | ✅   | ✅      | ❌     | ❌     | ❌        | ❌        |
| DevOps    | ✅   | ✅      | ✅     | ✅     | Read-only | Read-only |
| On-Call   | ✅   | ✅      | ✅     | ✅     | ✅        | Read-only |
| Admin     | ✅   | ✅      | ✅     | ✅     | ✅        | ✅        |

### 1.2 Access Request Workflow

**Process**:

1. **Request**: Submit ticket with justification and duration
2. **Approval**: Manager + Security Lead approval
3. **Grant**: Time-limited access (default: 8 hours)
4. **Audit**: All production access logged
5. **Revoke**: Auto-revoke after time limit

**Break-Glass Access**:

- Emergency admin access available
- Requires two-person approval (async if P0 incident)
- Audit trail mandatory
- Post-incident review required

---

## Phase 2: Automated Release Pipeline

### 2.1 Fully Automated Production Releases

**Goal**: Zero-touch production deployments

**Pipeline Stages**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Commit] --> B[CI Build]
    B --> C[Unit Tests]
    C --> D[Integration Tests]
    D --> E[Build Artifact]
    E --> F[Security Scan]
    F --> G[Deploy to Staging]
    G --> H[E2E Tests]
    H --> I[Deploy to Prod]
    I --> J[Smoke Tests]
    J --> K{Tests Pass?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Complete]
    K -->|No| M[Auto-Rollback]
```

**Deployment Triggers**:

- **Automatic**: On merge to `main` branch (after all checks pass)
- **Scheduled**: Off-peak hours (e.g., 2 AM UTC)
- **Manual**: Emergency hotfixes only

### 2.2 Binary Promotion (No Rebuilds)

**Principle**: Same artifact from dev → staging → production

**Artifact Provenance**:

```yaml
artifact_metadata:
  build_id: '20251122-1445-a3f2c1'
  commit_sha: 'a3f2c1d8e9b4...'
  branch: 'main'
  build_timestamp: '2025-11-22T14:45:00Z'
  tests_passed:
    - unit_tests: ✅
    - integration_tests: ✅
    - security_scan: ✅
    - e2e_tests: ✅
  deployed_to:
    - staging: '2025-11-22T15:00:00Z'
    - production: '2025-11-22T18:00:00Z'
```

**Benefits**:

- Deterministic deployments
- Faster releases (no rebuild time)
- Compliance (same tested artifact)
- Audit trail

---

## Phase 3: Blue/Green Deployment

### 3.1 Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

**Setup**:

- **Blue Environment**: Current production
- **Green Environment**: New version (standby)

**Process**:

1. **Deploy to Green**
   - Deploy new version to green environment
   - Green environment receives no traffic

2. **Smoke Test Green**

   ```bash
   # Automated smoke tests against green
   curl -f https://green.example.com/health
   curl -f https://green.example.com/api/version
   # Run critical path tests
   ```

3. **Traffic Shift** (gradual canary)

   ```
   Blue: 100% → 90% → 50% → 10% → 0%
   Green: 0% → 10% → 50% → 90% → 100%

   Duration: 30 minutes (5% every 3 minutes)
   ```

4. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Error rate
   - Response time
   - Success rate
   - Business metrics

5. **Rollback Decision**

   ```
   IF error_rate > threshold OR response_time > threshold THEN
     Instant rollback to blue
   ELSE
     Continue canary deployment
   ```

6. **Complete or Rollback**
   - **Success**: Green becomes new blue
   - **Failure**: Instant traffic shift back to blue

### 3.2 Automated Rollback

**Triggers**:

- Error rate spike (> 1% increase)
- Response time degradation (> 20% increase)
- Failed health checks
- Manual trigger by on-call

**Rollback Process**:

```
Trigger → Shift traffic to blue (< 5 seconds)
       → Alert on-call engineer
       → Preserve green for debugging
       → Create incident ticket
       → Root cause analysis required
```

---

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability

### 4.1 Monitoring Stack

**Components**:

1. **Metrics** (Prometheus, Datadog, CloudWatch)
   - Request rate
   - Error rate
   - Response time
   - Resource utilization

2. **Logs** (ELK, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs)
   - Application logs
   - Access logs
   - Error logs
   - Audit logs

3. **Traces** (Jaeger, X-Ray, Datadog APM)
   - Request flow
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Service dependencies

4. **Alerts** (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
   - Critical alerts → Page on-call
   - Warning alerts → Ticket creation
   - Info alerts → Dashboard only

### 4.2 Key Metrics Dashboard

**Golden Signals**:

1. **Latency**: How long requests take
2. **Traffic**: How many requests
3. **Errors**: How many requests fail
4. **Saturation**: How full the system is

**Business Metrics**:

- User registrations per hour
- API calls per minute
- Revenue-generating events
- Customer-impacting errors

### 4.3 Alert Configuration

**P0 (Critical) - Page Immediately**:

- Service down (health check fails)
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Data integrity issue

**P1 (High) - Page within 15 min**:

- Error rate > 2%
- Response time > 2 seconds
- Capacity at 80%

**P2 (Medium) - Create ticket**:

- Error rate > 1%
- Response time > 1 second
- Capacity at 70%

**P3 (Low) - Dashboard**:

- Minor performance degradation
- Non-critical service issues

## Phase 5: Incident Response

### 5.1 Incident Management Process

**Incident Roles**:

- **Incident Commander**: Coordinates response
- **Technical Lead**: Directs technical investigation
- **Communications Lead**: Updates stakeholders
- **Scribe**: Documents timeline and decisions

**Incident Workflow**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Alert/Report] --> B[Triage & Severity]
    B --> C{Severity?}
    C -->|P0| D[Page On-Call]
    C -->|P1| E[Notify On-Call]
    C -->|P2/P3| F[Create Ticket]
    D --> G[Incident Channel]
    E --> G
    G --> H[Investigation]
    H --> I[Mitigation]
    I --> J[Verification]
    J --> K{Resolved?}
    K -->|No| H
    K -->|Yes| L[Incident Report]
    L --> M[Post-Mortem]
    M --> N[Action Items]
```

### 5.2 Incident Communication

**Internal Updates**:

- Slack incident channel
- Every 30 minutes (P0)
- Every hour (P1)

**External Updates** (if customer-facing):

- Status page update
- Email to affected customers (if applicable)
- Post-incident summary

### 5.3 Post-Mortem

**Within 48 hours of P0/P1 incidents**:

**Format**:

```markdown
# Incident Post-Mortem: [Title]

## Summary

[One-paragraph summary]

## Timeline

- HH:MM - Alert triggered
- HH:MM - On-call paged

|----------|---------------|------------|
| Critical | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| High | 4 hours | 24 hours |
| Medium | 12 hours | 3 days |
| Low | 24 hours | 7 days |

```
Tier 1 Support (Customer Success)
    ↓ (if technical)
Tier 2 Support (Engineering)
    ↓ (if critical)
