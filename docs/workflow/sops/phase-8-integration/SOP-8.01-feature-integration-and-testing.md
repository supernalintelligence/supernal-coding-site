# Feature Integration & Testing

## Purpose

Integrate completed features into the epic/feature branch and ensure all components work together correctly.

## Scope

- Feature branch integration
- Integration testing
- Conflict resolution
- Epic-level validation
- Documentation updates

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Feature implementation complete (SOP-7.01)
- [ ] All feature tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Process Overview

### Step 1: Prepare for Integration

```bash
# Ensure feature branch is up to date
git checkout feature/req-001-auth
git pull origin main
git merge main

# Resolve any conflicts
# Run tests after merge
npm test
```

### Step 2: Integration Testing

**Test Epic-Level Functionality**:

- Multiple features working together
- Cross-feature interactions
- Shared resources (database, APIs)
- End-to-end flows spanning features

**Run Integration Test Suite**:

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests for epic
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "@epic-user-management"
```

### Step 3: Use Supernal Git-Smart

```bash
# Check branch status and requirements
sc git-smart check-branch

# Check if ready for merge
sc git-smart check-context

# Merge feature into epic/main
sc git-smart merge --push --delete-local

# Automatically:
# - Validates tests pass
# - Checks for conflicts
# - Updates requirement metadata
# - Pushes to remote
# - Deletes local branch
```

### Step 4: Validate Integration

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No regressions
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changelog updated

### Step 5: Update Tracking

```bash
# Update requirement status
sc req update REQ-001 --status=integrated

# Check epic progress
sc kanban show epic-user-management
```

## Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise:

1. Understand both changes
2. Consult with other developers
3. Preserve all intended functionality
4. Test thoroughly after resolution
5. Document resolution rationale

## Outputs

- **Integrated Code**: Features merged into epic branch
- **Test Results**: All integration tests passing
- **Updated Documentation**: Reflects integrated state
- **Requirement Status**: Updated to "integrated"

## Quality Gates

- [ ] All feature tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation current
- [ ] Performance validated

## Expected Documentation

### Feature-Specific

- **Feature Folder**: `docs/features/\{domain\}/{feature-name}/` (phase: testing)
  - `integration-results.md` - Integration test outcomes
  - `conflict-resolution.md` - How merge conflicts were resolved (if any)
  - `performance-results.md` - Performance test data

### Integration Records

- **Epic Status**: Update `docs/planning/epics/epic-[name].md` with integration status
- **Kanban**: Move tasks to "Integrated" column in `docs/planning/kanban/`

### Small Changes

- Integration notes in merge commit messages
- Update feature README with integration status
