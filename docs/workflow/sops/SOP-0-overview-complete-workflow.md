# SOP-000: Complete Development Workflow

## Purpose

End-to-end development process from business discovery through production deployment. Organized around natural work breakdown hierarchy: Milestone → Epic → Feature → Task → Component.

## Key Principles

1. **Hierarchical Breakdown**: Milestone → Epic → Feature → Task → Component
2. **Approval Gates**: Clear sign-offs at each level
3. **Compliance Everywhere**: Security and compliance integrated at all stages
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: AI assists; humans approve and decide
5. **Iterative**: Each phase allows for human evaluation and iteration

## Overview: 12-Phase Process

| Phase        | Quality Gate                                                                       | Responsible                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1**  | Business analyzed to find discovery "We found something that needs a solution!"    | Business Team                      |
| **Phase 2**  | Research, user stories collected model approved "What might solve this?"           | Product Owner + Architect          |
| **Phase 3**  | Architecture and approximate domain (UI and Backend): "How should we make this?"   | Architect + Security Lead          |
| **Phase 3b** | Compliance plan: "How should we make this safely?"                                 | Compliance Officer + Security Lead |
| **Phase 4**  | Planning and breakdown of features, tasks, and epics: "When will we make what?"    | Product Owner + Architect          |
| **Phase 5**  | Technical requirements created, specific domain modeling (per feature)             | Product Owner + Tech Lead          |
| **Phase 6**  | Tests created and validated (per feature)                                          | QA Team + Developers               |
| **Phase 7**  | Components built and tested to pass tests (per feature)                            | Developers + AI                    |
| **Phase 8**  | Integration of features into epics. E2E tests completed. Security tests completed. | QA Team + Security Lead            |
| **Phase 9**  | Integration of epics into milestones                                               | Tech Lead + Product Owner          |
| **Phase 10** | Deployment to staging environment. AI agentic testing completed.                   | Ops Team + QA Team                 |
| **Phase 11** | Production deployment approved                                                     | Ops Lead + Stakeholders            |
| **Phase 12** | Production monitoring stable (Ongoing)                                             | Ops Team                           |
