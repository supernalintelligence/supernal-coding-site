# SOP-1.02: Solution & Technology Landscape Analysis

**Location**: `docs/workflow/sops/phase-1-discovery/SOP-1.02-solution-technology-analysis.md`  
**Phase**: 1 - Discovery  
**Purpose**: Compare existing solutions, technologies, and approaches before designing your own  
**Prerequisites**: SOP-1.01 (Business Vision & Problem Definition)

---

## Overview

**Critical Principle**: Never build without understanding what already exists.

Before designing your solution, you must understand:

1. **Existing solutions** - What's already solving this problem?
2. **Available technologies** - What tools, libraries, and services exist?
3. **Feature comparisons** - What do they do well? What's missing?
4. **Implementation patterns** - How do others approach this?

**Goal**: Move from "I need to build X" to "I will build X using approaches Y and Z, avoiding problems A and B"

## Why This Matters

### Common Pitfalls Without This Analysis

❌ Reinventing the wheel (poorly)  
❌ Choosing wrong tech stack  
❌ Missing critical features  
❌ Underestimating complexity  
❌ Building what already exists (better)

### Benefits of Thorough Analysis

✅ Learn from others' mistakes  
✅ Adopt proven patterns  
✅ Make informed technology choices  
✅ Avoid common pitfalls  
✅ Identify gaps in existing solutions  
✅ Set realistic expectations

```

---

## Step 4: Implementation Patterns Research

### AI Implementation Research Prompt

```
You: "Research how [companies/projects] implement [specific feature]:

Examples:
- "How does Stripe implement API versioning?"
- "How does GitHub handle real-time notifications?"
- "How does Snowflake implement data sharing?"
- "How does Auth0 handle multi-tenancy?"

For each, document:
1. The approach they use
2. Why they chose it
3. Trade-offs they made
4. What they'd do differently
5. Relevant blog posts, talks, documentation

Use research to find current best practices."
```

### Example Output: `06-implementation-patterns.md`

````markdown
# Implementation Patterns Research

## API Design Patterns

### 1. Versioning Strategy

**Stripe's Approach**: ✅ RECOMMENDED

- Date-based versioning in header
- `Stripe-Version: 2024-11-22`
- No breaking changes in same version
- Long deprecation windows (12-24 months)
- Excellent API changelog

**Why This Works**:

- No `/v1/` `/v2/` URL mess
- Clients control upgrade timing
- Backward compatible
- Easy to test multiple versions

**Our Implementation**:

```typescript
// API middleware
const API_VERSION_HEADER = 'X-API-Version';
const DEFAULT_VERSION = '2024-11-22';

// Client specifies version
headers: {
  'X-API-Version': '2024-11-22'
}
```
````

---

### 2. Authentication Patterns

**Auth0's Multi-Tenancy**: ✅ RECOMMENDED

- Separate database per tenant (data isolation)
- Shared auth infrastructure
- JWT with tenant claim
- Per-tenant API keys

**Our Adaptation**:

```go
type JWTClaims struct {
    UserID   string `json:"user_id"`
    TenantID string `json:"tenant_id"` // Organization
    Role     string `json:"role"`
    jwt.RegisteredClaims
}
```

---

## Data Access Patterns

### 1. Direct Access vs Proxy

**Snowflake's Delta Sharing**: ✅ STUDY THIS

- Uses pre-signed URLs (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- No data proxy (performance)
- Time-limited tokens
- Audit logging at source

**Why This Works**:

- Fast (no middleman)
- Scalable (no bottleneck)
- Cost-effective (no bandwidth cost)
- Secure (short-lived tokens)

**Our Implementation**:

```go
// Generate pre-signed URL
func (s *DataAccessService) GenerateAccessURL(
    datasetID string,
    userID string,
    expiresIn time.Duration,
) (string, error) {
    // 1. Verify user permission
    // 2. Generate pre-signed URL (S3/GCS)
    // 3. Log access request
    // 4. Return URL with expiry
}
```

---

### 2. Access Revocation

**GitHub's Token Patterns**: ✅ RECOMMENDED

- Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
- Long-lived refresh tokens (90 days)
- Token can be revoked instantly
- Separate "fine-grained" tokens for specific resources

**Our Pattern**:

- Access token: 1 hour (dataset access)
- Refresh token: 7 days (renew access)
- Per-dataset tokens (not global)
- Instant revocation in database

---

## Real-Time Updates

### 1. Change Notifications

**GitHub's Approach**: Webhooks + Polling  
**Vercel's Approach**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)  
**Supabase's Approach**: WebSocket subscriptions

**Our Recommendation**: Start simple, grow as needed

- **Phase 1**: Polling (good enough)
- **Phase 2**: Webhooks (scale to thousands)
- **Phase 3**: WebSocket (if real-time chat needed)

---

## Security Patterns

### 1. Rate Limiting

**Stripe's Pattern**: ✅ COPY THIS

- Per-endpoint rate limits
- Per-user limits
- Per-IP limits (unauthenticated)
- Gradual backoff
- Clear error messages

```
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1700000000
Retry-After: 60
```

---

### 2. API Key Management

**SendGrid's Pattern**: ✅ EXCELLENT

- Scoped API keys (read-only, write, admin)
- Per-resource keys (for specific datasets)
- Key rotation without downtime
- Usage tracking per key

---

## Key Takeaways

### Adopt These Patterns

1. ✅ **Stripe-style versioning** (date-based headers)
2. ✅ **Pre-signed URLs** (for data access, like Snowflake)
3. ✅ **Short-lived tokens** (1 hour access, 7 day refresh)
4. ✅ **Scoped API keys** (per-dataset, like SendGrid)
5. ✅ **Clear rate limits** (with helpful headers, like Stripe)

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. ❌ Don't proxy data (use pre-signed URLs)
2. ❌ Don't use URL versioning (`/v1/`, `/v2/`)
3. ❌ Don't use long-lived access tokens
4. ❌ Don't build custom auth (use OAuth2/JWT standards)
5. ❌ Don't skip rate limiting (learned the hard way)

### Research Sources

**Do**: Time-box research (1-2 weeks), make decisions, validate with POC

### ❌ Cargo Cult Engineering

**Don't**: "Google uses X, so we must use X"  
**Do**: Understand WHY they use it and if it fits YOUR context

### ❌ Resume-Driven Development

**Don't**: Choose tech because you want to learn it  
**Do**: Choose based on project needs and team skills

### ❌ Not Invented Here Syndrome

**Don't**: Reject good solutions because they're not your idea  
**Do**: Embrace proven patterns and technologies

### ❌ Hype-Driven Development

**Don't**: Use newest, shiniest tech without validation  
**Do**: Choose mature, proven technologies for critical paths

- Why they migrated
- What problems they hit
- What they'd do differently
- Would they recommend it?"
```

### Challenge Your Assumptions

```
"I'm thinking of using [Technology X].
Play devil's advocate:
- What could go wrong?
- What am I not considering?
- What would make this a bad choice?
- What's the strongest argument AGAINST it?"
```
