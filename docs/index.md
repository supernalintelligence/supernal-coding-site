# Supernal Coding Documentation

Welcome to Supernal Coding - an AI-accelerated development workflow system that helps teams build better software faster.

## Quick Links

- [Requirements System](/docs/guides/requirements)
- [Git Workflow](/docs/guides/git-workflow)
- [Testing](/docs/guides/testing)

## What is Supernal Coding?

Supernal Coding provides the structure, validation, and automation that turns AI assistance into AI acceleration. Instead of just generating code, AI agents understand your:

- **Requirements** (Gherkin-based specs)
- **Workflow** (Git hooks, pre-staging, validation)
- **Tests** (Auto-generated from requirements)
- **Compliance** (GDPR, SOC2, ISO13485, FDA)

## Key Features

### 📋 Requirement Management

Write requirements in Gherkin format that both humans and AI can understand. Automatic validation ensures requirements are complete and testable.

### 🔄 Workflow Automation

Git hooks and pre-staging keep your codebase clean. AI commits are validated before they reach your repo.

### 🧪 Test-First Development

Generate tests from requirements. AI writes code that passes your specs, not the other way around.

### ✅ Compliance Tracking

Built-in support for GDPR, SOC2, ISO13485, and FDA 21 CFR Part 11. Audit-ready documentation generated automatically.

### 📊 Real-Time Dashboard

Monitor workflow status, requirement progress, and team activity in real-time.
